Six individuals were captured (trap success 1.9%) from 810 trap-nights. This low number suggests that the water rat population in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve is much smaller than anecdotal evidence would suggest. Home-range size (neighbour-linkage method) averaged 18.9ha (&#xb1;11.6). Individuals preferentially utilised wetland habitats characterised by dense, low-lying vegetation (0&#x2013;30cm from ground), low-density canopy cover and shallow, narrow water bodies.", "keywords": "water rat, radio tracking, habitat use, home range."}}
