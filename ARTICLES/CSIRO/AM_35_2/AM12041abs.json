Reducing the potentially negative impacts from the attachment of telemetry devices is a key consideration in this area. The corrosive effect when copper, magnesium alloy and brass are connected through water acting as an electrolyte oxidises the magnesium alloy. I tested a range of magnesium washers as part of a light-weight, time-programmable, time-release mechanism fitted to telemetry collars to ensure that devices do not remain on indefinitely. Six of the eight washers in the trial corroded and released the collar between 71 and 191 days. This mechanism has potential application to a wide variety of mammals and telemetry research projects.", "keywords": null}}
