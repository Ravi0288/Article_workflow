A burrow system was excavated in a sandy woodland area of Groote Eylandt to confirm it was used by northern hopping-mice, describe its structure, and relate structure to surface signs. The burrow was T-shaped, ~2m long and wide, and connected to four vertical shafts leading to pop-hole-entrances/exits. The depth of the burrow was constrained by a rocky layer ~0.5m below the surface. It was occupied by five hopping-mice, three of which were caught. The burrow systems dug by northern hopping-mice are more complex and extensive than those of delicate mice, Pseudomys delicatulus, and the major surface signs (spoil heaps or mounds) left by northern hopping-mice are unmarked by entrances or tracks, whereas those of delicate mice are marked by an entrance and trackways (if occupied).", "keywords": {"i": "Pseudomys delicatulus", "#text": "delicate mouse, mound, , spoil, tunnel."}}}
