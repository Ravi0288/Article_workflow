Studies quantifying the location and rate of roadkill to identify \"hot spots&#x2019; are often used to guide the location of mitigation efforts, such as fencing or wildlife crossing structures. However, sometimes quantifying rates of roadkill can be challenging, particularly for species that are small and difficult to detect. In our study, a squirrel glider that was trapped and radio-collared in north-east Victoria was found as roadkill more than 500km away, suggesting that a vehicle struck the animal and carried the carcass away from the site of impact. Our observation is the first evidence that this occurs for squirrel gliders.", "keywords": null}}
