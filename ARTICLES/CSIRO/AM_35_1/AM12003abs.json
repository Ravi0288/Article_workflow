The digestive tract was simple, with no external differentiation between the small and large intestine, and lacked a caecum. Mean gross length of the kultarr digestive tract was 165.2&#xb1;32.1mm. Microscopically, the tissues had cell types similar to those of other mammals. The new information will aid future post-mortem investigations of captive kultarrs and future studies of nutrition.", "keywords": "dasyurid, digestive histology, digestive morphology, marsupial"}}
