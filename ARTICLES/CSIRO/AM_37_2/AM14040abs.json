Little is known about the temperatures that may be experienced inside nest boxes or the factors that may influence those temperatures. I established paired nest boxes on the south-east and north-west sides of trees at two locations in south-east Queensland to investigate the influence of nest box aspect on nest box temperature. Squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) occupied boxes at both locations. I recorded temperatures over a 1-month period in two summers. Temperature varied by up to 20&#xb0;C within a 24-h period and some nest boxes experienced temperatures above 40&#xb0;C. There was no significant difference in maximum temperature with nest box aspect but south-east boxes could be 1&#xb0;C cooler during hot weather. Nest box construction material, colour (brown or green) and volume (0.008m3 or 0.025m3) had variable influences on temperature. Nest box installations for non-flying mammals should place nest boxes to minimise extreme temperatures. Further studies are required to determine whether temperature limits the effectiveness of nest boxes at some locations.", "keywords": null}}
