These findings have implications for captive breeding programs, providing evidence that older females can be successfully bred. In the longer term we hope these findings may aid conservation efforts of this endangered dasyurid.", "keywords": "captivity, dasyurid, fertility, marsupial, reproduction, semelparity."}}
