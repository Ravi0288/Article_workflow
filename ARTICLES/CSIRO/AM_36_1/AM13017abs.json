Three native mammals (agile antechinus, Antechinus agilis; dusky antechinus, Antechinus swainsonii; bush rat, Rattus fuscipes) were encountered. Trapping records and spool-and-line movement patterns suggested a strong association of these small mammals with moist gully vegetation that had survived the fire.", "keywords": {"i": ["Antechinus", "Rattus"], "#text": ", Brindabellas, Elliott, , road-crossing."}}}
