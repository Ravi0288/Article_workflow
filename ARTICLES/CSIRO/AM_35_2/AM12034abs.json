Predation by reptiles was observed on six of 61 radio-tracked pygmy-possums, while two were suspected of being taken by raptors. We further investigated predation by sooty owls (Tyto tenebricosa) by identifying remains in pellets. Pygmy-possums comprised 15% of the 126 dietary items identified. Predation occurred at both logged and unlogged sites in our study. We suggest that documented high rates of predation in our study could make the species vulnerable to altered predation regimes, such as influxes of feral predators, and highlight the need for a better understanding of any influence of logging on predator activity.", "keywords": null}}
