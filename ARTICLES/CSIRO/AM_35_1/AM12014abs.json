Often camera traps need to be placed along vehicle tracks or in obvious locations to detect animal activity. Consequently, units are frequently highly visible and therefore easily located by would-be thieves. We describe a field-tested security post design that increases security for both camera traps and data, whilst also offering a means of standardising placement.", "keywords": "carnivores, tracks."}}
