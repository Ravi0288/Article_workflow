Perth Zoo has been successful in breeding echidnas on five occasions, with young produced over 3 consecutive years. In this paper we document the results of intensive monitoring undertaken before and during these successful breeding seasons. Video camera surveillance was used to monitor activity and reproductive behaviour of adults during the courtship and mating period and to identify the timing and duration of incubation. Temperature data loggers were used to record and compare proximal body temperature with observed behaviours. Echidnas were found to breed in June and July, with courtship lasting a mean 5.75&#xb1;1.7 days (range 4&#x2013;9 days, n=8). Mean duration of gestation was 21.8&#xb1;2.4 days (range 19&#x2013;27 days, n=7). Females incubated their single egg for a mean 11&#xb1;0.75 days (range 11&#x2013;13 days, n=5) in an artificial burrow with increased temperature stability.", "keywords": "captive management, reproductive biology, Tachyglossidae."}}
