Aspects of the anatomy of reproductive structures and the pattern of reproduction of P. ingrami were established by examination of specimens extracted from the stomachs of feral cats shot in north-western Queensland. This species has an extended breeding season that commences in August and probably ends in December, and both males and females may live to breed in more than one season, providing support for the similarity of the reproductive strategies of these three species of Planigale. Females of P. ingrami have twelve nipples in the pouch, the form of which may differ from that of other planigales. Pouch morphology may prove useful in the identification of species of Planigale providing observations are made on the appearance of the pouch throughout the breeding cycle.", "keywords": {"i": ["Planigale gilesi", "Planigale ingrami", "Planigale maculata", "Planigale tenuirostris"], "#text": "life-history strategy, , , , , pouch morphology."}}}
