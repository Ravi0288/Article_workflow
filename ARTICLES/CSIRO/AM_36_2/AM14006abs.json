I describe aspects of the glide performance of the yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) based on 22 glides of 17 individuals within 20&#x2013;30-m-high open forest in western Victoria. Gliders launched into a glide from a horizontal branch that was, on average, 2.8m below the top of a tree, 5.2m out from the main trunk and 18.5m above the ground. Gliders landed on the trunks of trees 5.8m above the ground. The mean horizontal glide distance was 25.2&#xb1;1.5m (s.e.) (range=19&#x2013;45m), producing a glide ratio (horizontal distance/height dropped) of 2.0 and a glide angle of 27.3&#xb0;. These values are similar to those reported for other gliding petaurids in low-canopy forest. This knowledge should be used to guide the management of habitat connectivity for yellow-bellied gliders.", "keywords": null}}
