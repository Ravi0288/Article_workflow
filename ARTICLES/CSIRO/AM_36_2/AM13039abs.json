New burrows were observed at the beginning and end of the wet season on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory. Initial burrow entrances were open for approximately five days before being back-filled, leaving only a spoil heap with pop holes (burrow entrances) up to 5.3m away. These results will improve survey techniques for this cryptic, threatened species.", "keywords": {"i": "Dasyurus hallucatus", "#text": ", Muridae, predation, rodent."}}}
