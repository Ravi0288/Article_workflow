Their establishment was monitored initially by radio-telemetry and trapping, and subsequently by the checking of nest boxes both within and outside the sanctuary. Translocated phascogales established well and bred successfully in their first season. Phascogales remain extant at Wadderin more than five years after release and appear to be abundant and to occupy all available habitat. They have spread beyond the fenced sanctuary to adjoining woodland and to shrubland and woodland habitat in a remnant 1.4km away. Comparison with two other reintroductions of this species (one apparently successful, one not) suggests management and habitat factors that may have contributed to the outcomes.", "keywords": "Dasyuridae, translocation."}}
