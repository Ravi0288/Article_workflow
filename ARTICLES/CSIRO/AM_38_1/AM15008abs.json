Habitat requirements and diet of these populations are poorly understood. Determining the diet of inland ringtail possums is crucial to understanding the factors limiting their survival, and was the focus of this study. Spotlighting surveys were conducted to locate ringtail possums, and scat and vegetation samples were collected for microhistological analysis. Ringtail possums were most frequently observed in red stringybark followed by bundy box and black cypress pine trees, and this correlated with the most common dietary items consumed.", "keywords": "black cypress pine, bundy box, marsupial, microhistological analysis, red stringybark."}}
