Fungus was detected in bandicoot diets in all seasons, but samples from autumn and winter were more likely to contain fungi, and more taxa were consumed in these seasons, compared with spring and summer. Individual scat samples also contained more spore types in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. My results support other work in temperate south-eastern Australia that indicate an autumn and winter peak in fungal availability, and a stronger focus on fungal consumption by mammals at this time of year.", "keywords": null}}
