All specimens showed a significant correlation between the load applied and the depth of penetration into the gel. There was no significant difference between the penetration ability of the echidna spines and the porcupine quills despite the finding that quills had a significantly smaller angle at the tip of the spine (opening angle). The penetration ability of echidna spines was inversely related to the opening angle whereas there was no such correlation in porcupine quills. These findings are discussed in relation to the different response of these two species to possible predators.", "keywords": null}}
