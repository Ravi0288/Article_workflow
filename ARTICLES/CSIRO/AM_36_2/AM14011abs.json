In order to capture an entire population of bilbies in the Arid Recovery Reserve of central South Australia, we developed an improved method of using burrow cage traps. Traps were set to engulf the entrance of the burrow and the base was camouflaged with sand. We obtained a very high capture rate (6% overall, and 73% for confirmed burrows). Assuming that occupied burrows can be detected, this method should improve capture rates for this endangered and cryptic species.", "keywords": null}}
