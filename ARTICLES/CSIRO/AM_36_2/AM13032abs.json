Koala activity was recorded from 49 regional ecosystems across nine land zones and five bioregions. Thirty-four tree species were identified from an examination of leaf cuticle fragments in faecal pellets. Although the species were from three families and seven genera, 44% of browse species (15) belonged to the myrtaceous subgenus Symphomyrtus. Eleven of these contributed most of the koala diet across all sites. However, most species were present in minor or trace dietary elements. There was also a large number of unidentified species or dietary elements, all of which were usually present in trace amounts. The importance of these minor and trace components is not known. Diet at some sites was founded on a single eucalypt species. Here the likelihood of those sites&#x2019; browse resources being lost or degraded by stochastic events, as climate variability increases, raises questions about the persistence of the resident koala populations.", "keywords": {"i": ["Eucalyptus", "Monocalyptus", "Symphomyrtus"], "#text": "climate variability, , faecal pellet, leaf cuticle, , ."}}}
