This has been especially prevalent in the translocation of threatened species in south-west Western Australia. Translocations can fail for several reasons such as stress, disease and predation and, less frequently, homing behaviours of translocated individuals. We report on one of eight chuditch, Dasyurus geoffroii, that was recaptured near the original point of capture 12 days after release at the designated translocation site in George State Forest Block, 14km to the south. During that period she had lost 12.5% of her body weight, but was otherwise in good condition. It is possible that this event was unique to this individual and the other seven chuditch remained within the translocation site of George Block. However, this species is known to travel long distances and have large home ranges. It is important to determine the propensity of this species to attempt homing after translocation in an effort to determine whether a minimum release distance is necessary.", "keywords": null}}
