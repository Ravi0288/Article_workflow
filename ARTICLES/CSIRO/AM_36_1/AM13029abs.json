The Tasmanian occurrence is the only known population of this species outside its natural geographical range. The current wild population is likely to have originated from a small number of individuals that escaped or were released from a nearby wildlife park in the late 1990s. The population is successfully reproducing although it appears to be relatively small and restricted. A precautionary approach is needed and the eradication of the population is recommended.", "keywords": {"i": "Macropus agilis", "#text": "eradication, invasive species, , zoo escape."}}}
