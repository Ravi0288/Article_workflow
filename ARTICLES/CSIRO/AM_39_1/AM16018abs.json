Here, we report on camera trap observations of dingoes feeding on the carcasses of dingoes and showing aggressive behaviours towards live-trapped conspecifics. At this site, cannibalism and conspecific aggression by dingoes was not caused by food shortages, but was more likely a result of high dingo density in a focal area. We present the first camera trap image observations of dingoes eating dingoes and describe aggressive encounters between live animals.", "keywords": "camera trap, diet, predation, scavenging, wild dog."}}
