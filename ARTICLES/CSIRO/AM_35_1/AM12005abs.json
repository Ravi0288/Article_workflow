Fleming et al. (2012) [Australian Mammalogy 34, 119&#x2013;131] offer the alternative view that restoration of dingo predation is unlikely to help native species, and is more likely to do harm. We think many of the arguments used by Fleming et al. to reach that conclusion are either unsound or beside the point, and we explain why.", "keywords": {"i": "Canis lupus", "#text": ", ecological restoration, feral cat, mesopredator release, red fox, trophic cascade."}}}
