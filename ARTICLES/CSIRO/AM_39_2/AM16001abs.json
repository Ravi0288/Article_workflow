We present here a low-cost, modular passive infrared sensor and data-logging system for use in experiments evaluating animal activity and behaviour, easily assembled in a laboratory setting. This system comprises accessible kit-based components purchased from popular electronics suppliers. We present the hardware configuration, software coding, build of materials, circuit diagram and a sample dataset demonstrating that the system collects reliable data that is easily downloaded either through any terminal program, directly from the unit or via an SD card. It is hoped that this \"freeware&#x2019; approach to activity-monitoring equipment will enable laboratory and enclosure-based research to be undertaken more cost-effectively.", "keywords": "activity, Arduino, dunnart, laboratory and enclosure experimentation, passive infrared sensor, PIR."}}
