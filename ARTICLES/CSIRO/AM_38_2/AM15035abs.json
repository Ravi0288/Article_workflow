Two have been identified as Arctocephalus forsteri on the basis of photographs, a juvenile or weaned pup that weighed 9.5kg and a subadult male. The nearest known aggregation of these fur seals is at Three Kings Islands (34&#xb0;S, 172&#xb0;E), 700km to the south-east. Because New Zealand fur seals are increasing in abundance in New Zealand and Australia, sightings of vagrant fur seals at Norfolk Island are likely to increase.", "keywords": {"i": ["Arctocephalus forsteri", "Isistius", "Lepas anatifera", "Panulirus versicolor"], "#text": ", cookie cutter shark, crayfish, goose barnacles,  sp., , long-nosed fur seals, New Zealand fur seals, , vagrant fur seals."}}}
