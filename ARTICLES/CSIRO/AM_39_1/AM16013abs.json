A short-term study was carried out in Bladensburg National Park, near the southern edge of its known distribution on the Mitchell grass downs in Queensland. Radio-collared individuals were located in cracks and holes. None of the males and females (including one with young in the pouch) were found to use the same resting site over periods of up to nine days, suggesting that they may be nomadic. Climatic factors may have affected the size of the dunnart population over the course of the study.", "keywords": "home range, nomadic, radio-tracking, threatened species."}}
