The species occurs in a variety of habitats and like many arid-zone rodents, its distribution and abundance is known to fluctuate with environmental conditions. Following the capture of a suspected specimen of P. desertor outside the current known range of the species, we used molecular-based methods to confirm the specimen&#x2019;s identification as P. desertor. This note presents a record of the species north of Dalwallinu, Western Australia, which represents a significant range extension for the species of 324km from the nearest confirmed record.", "keywords": {"i": "Pseudomys desertor", "#text": "conilurine rodent, distribution, mitochondrial DNA, Muridae, , Western Australia."}}}
