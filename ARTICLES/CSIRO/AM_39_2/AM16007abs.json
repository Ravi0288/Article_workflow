The current study provides the first quantitative assessment of the occurrence of various cetacean species in inshore waters during 391 systematic, one-hour observation periods over 59 weeks, in 2002 and 2003. Nine species of cetacean were identified during these surveys. Killer whales, long-finned pilot whales and sperm whales were all detected with some frequency. All other species were detected on single occasions. Eight previously unpublished stranding records are also summarised. These results support the notion that most cetacean species are relatively uncommon in the inshore waters of Macquarie Island. Routine archiving of cetacean sightings obtained during shipping activities in surrounding waters is encouraged as this will further contribute to our understanding of the region&#x2019;s marine megafauna.", "keywords": "beaked whale, killer whale, long-finned pilot whale, seasonal patterns, spectacled porpoise, strandings, underestimate."}}
