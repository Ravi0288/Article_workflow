It may occur in other macropodids. It is suggested that the primary function of lip-licking is the transfer of saliva to the fore-stomach of the licker so as to maintain water content of digesta at a sufficient level for efficient digestive fermentation. Lip-licking may be a useful behavioural indicator that water intake from milk, vegetation or drinking water is inadequate.The occurrence of the behaviour outside the mother&#x2013;young relationship is indicative of the high level of cooperation that has evolved in Petrogale assimilis.", "keywords": "trapping stress, weaning, water intake."}}
