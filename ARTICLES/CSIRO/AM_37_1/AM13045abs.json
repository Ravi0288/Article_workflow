The endangered northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) was recorded from two distinct locations of similar habitat: deep dissected rocky gorges containing caves and permanent waterholes. One individual was photographed by a motion-sensitive camera and several scats were collected, with mitochondrial DNA analysis confirming the identification. These records represent a significant range extension (~200km) and due to habitat restrictions are likely to represent the very eastern extreme of the species&#x2019; range.", "keywords": null}}
