Mitochondrial DNA sequences derived from five scats show that the new individuals nest within a clade containing all other Pilbara animals. Northern quolls from the Pilbara Bioregion are genetically distinct from congeners from the Kimberley Bioregion. We note that there is no evidence for maternal gene flow between these two regions.", "keywords": {"i": "Dasyurus hallucatus", "#text": ", gene flow, Pilbara Bioregion."}}}
