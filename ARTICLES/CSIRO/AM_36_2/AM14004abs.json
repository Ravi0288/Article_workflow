Seven remote camera surveys were undertaken at a monitoring site between February 2012 and October 2013. An 11% reduction in bettong detections was observed immediately following the first appearance of feral cats (Felis catus) (at least three individuals) at the site. Within four months, bettong detections had fallen by 58% and by 100% within six months. No bettongs were detected in subsequent surveys undertaken 10, 12 and 16 months after cats were first observed. Cat predation and toxoplasmosis are discussed as mechanisms possibly responsible for the local disappearance of bettongs from this site, together with implications for the future management and conservation of the species.", "keywords": {"i": "Toxoplasma gondii", "#text": "eastern bettong, eastern rat-kangaroo, predation, , toxoplasmosis."}}}
