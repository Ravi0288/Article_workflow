We report the first known predation of this species by a reptile, the carpet python (Morelia spilota), based on the identification of hair retrieved from a road-killed python. We describe characteristics of the hair sample and comment on implications that diverse foraging strategies in a reptilian predator may have for prey behaviour and vulnerability.", "keywords": "Atherton Tablelands, hair identification, tropical rainforest, Wet Tropics."}}
