The minimal inhibitory concentration for the susceptible organisms was less than 3 \u03bcg\/ml. The action of MCR was bactericidal; however, at very high concentrations (50 \u03bcg\/ml and above) some organisms occasionally escaped death. None of the escaped organisms was resistant to MCR. In combination with other commonly used antibiotics, MCR displayed partial synergy for\n            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/jats:italic>\n            (from a minimal inhibitory concentration of &gt;100 to 12.5 \u03bcg\/ml with 100 \u03bcg of chloramphenicol per ml) and for\n            <jats:italic>Bacillus pumilus<\/jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus<\/jats:italic>\n            (from 1.6 to 0.4 \u03bcg\/ml and below) with polymyxin B. As with mammalian cells,\n            <jats:sup>125<\/jats:sup>\n            I-labeled MCR was irreversibly bound to both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Treatment with trypsin of the\n            <jats:sup>125<\/jats:sup>\n            I-labeled MCR-exposed cells did not release the bound MCR or reverse its lethal effect. When in solution in a protective buffer at 4\u00b0C, MCR was stable for up to 45 days; at 37\u00b0C, however, 25% of its bactericidal activity was lost in 72 h. Loss of activity was enhanced 16-fold in the presence of both heated and unheated pooled human sera. Urine had no effect on the activity of MCR.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1128\/aac.11.6.1010","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,27]],"date-time":"2012-06-27T23:57:02Z","timestamp":1340841422000},"page":"1010-1016","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/asmj-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Bactericidal Activity of Macromomycin, an Antitumor Antibiotic"],"prefix":"10.1128","volume":"11","author":[{"given":"Francis L.
