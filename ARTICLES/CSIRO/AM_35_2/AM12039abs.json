In the present study, paternity patterns in the swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus), a small carnivorous marsupial, were investigated using genetic analyses. Microsatellite data confirmed that, of 10 litters sampled from two habitats, a minimum of eight litters were sired by more than one male. Mating with multiple males may enable female swamp antechinuses to increase offspring viability and to ensure fertilisation.", "keywords": "behaviour, dasyurid, mammal, reproduction, sperm competition."}}
