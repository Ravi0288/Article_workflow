Liver weight was also lower in mice fed with a high-fat diet supplemented with 10% RLP compared to those fed with low-fat and high-fat diet groups, suggesting a positive effect of lettuce powder on liver health.

The goal of this study was to evaluate potential changes in the microbiome and diversity of beneficial microbial communities in the soil suppressive to soilborne pathogens in long-term continuous corn compared to rotation corn field. Samples were collected three times during the year from four locations in Nebraska.

Mineralizable nitrogen, carbon (IV) oxide carbon, and biomass carbon evaluated for microbial activity showed a consistent pattern. Comparisons among field locations reflected a relatively higher operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for potential biocontrol agents Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Massilia, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas in the long-term continuous corn field compared to other three locations. The taxonomic composition of the fungal communities revealed a high population of Fusarium or the anamorph, Gibberella, in the rotation field compared to the long-term continuous corn field.

Doing so is of utmost importance, as improving pollinator resource availability and nutrition is one of the proposed mechanisms to improve populations and pollinator health. However, landscape change has changed the resources naturally available for pollinators. Farmland and cropping systems create a unique nutritional landscape for pollinators, with agroecosystems typically containing few crops dominating a landscape along with natural corridors containing noncrop plants. The types of crops planted and the surrounding landscape will ultimately affect the nutritional landscape bees have access to. Even the management practices in agriculture and how pests are controlled will, directly and indirectly, affect bee health and nutrition. Hence, a better understanding of bee nutrition in agricultural ecosystems is warranted.

In this study, we evaluated genomic prediction accuracy using multi\u2010trait BayesC\u03c0 method (MT\u2010BayesC\u03c0), which allows for a broader range of mixture priors for important traits in beef cattle. We compared the prediction performance of MT\u2010BayesC\u03c0 with single\u2010trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ST\u2010GBLUP), multi\u2010trait GBLUP (MT\u2010GBLUP), and single\u2010trait BayeC\u03c0 (ST\u2010BayesC\u03c0) methods. We found that ribeye area (REA) and ribeye weight (REWT) showed high heritability, while slaughter weight (SWT) and carcass weight (CWT) displayed medium\u00a0heritability, and slaughter rate (SR) and feedlot average daily gain (FDG) showed low heritability. Highly positive genetic correlations were observed between CWT and SWT (0.981) and SR and REWT (0.921). Notably, the MT\u2010BayesC\u03c0 method showed superior predictive abilities compared to other models. Using MT\u2010BayesC\u03c0 method, the accuracy increased from 0.272 to 0.694 for CWT compared to ST\u2010GBLUP and ST\u2010BayesC\u03c0. MT\u2010GBLUP and ST\u2010BayesC\u03c0 showed similar prediction accuracies, while MT\u2010BayesC\u03c0 showed the least biased evaluations.

A measure of total ingredient buffering (\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22) was defined as the area under the buffer capacity curve of a food mixture or ingredient for pH 2\u201312. Citric acid (1% w/v), elderberry juice (75% v/v), and malic acid (0.75%\u00a0w/v) had greater buffering (\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22 values of 15.33, 12.00, and 10.95, respectively) than ascorbic acid (0.75%) or lemon juice (3%\u00a0v/v) (\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22 of 5.74 and 3.30, respectively). All other ingredients, including added spices (\u22641% each) and honey (25%\u00a0w/v), had \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22 values &lt;2. The observed pH for the syrup mixture (pH 2.67) was within 0.11\u00a0pH units of the predicted pH based on combined buffer models of the acid and low acid ingredients (pH 2.78) using Matlab software. A total of 16 model syrup formulations containing elderberry juice with mixed acids (malic, acetic, and ascorbic) and having pH values between 3 and 4 were prepared. The pH values of the formulations were compared to predicted values from combined buffer models of the individual ingredients. Regression analysis indicated an excellent fit of the observed and predicted pH data, with a root mean square error of 0.076\u00a0pH units. The results indicated that buffer models may be useful for in silico estimates of how the ingredients in acid and acidified foods may influence pH, thus aiding in product development and safety assessments. Practical Application: Buffer models using recently developed titration methods for individual acid and low\u2010acid food ingredients can be used to estimate the pH of formulations of these ingredients in silico. The total buffering (\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22) for ingredients or mixtures, along with ingredient concentrations, may be a useful metric for helping to determine which ingredients will have the greatest impact on pH. Such models can aid product development efforts and safety assessments.

Combining hyperspectral imaging and deep learning has shown promise in identifying food safety and quality attributes. However, the challenge lies in acquiring a large amount of accurately annotated/labeled data for model training. This paper proposes a novel semisupervised hyperspectral deep learning model based on a generative adversarial network, utilizing an improved 1D U-Net as its discriminator, to detect FMs on raw chicken breast fillets. The model was trained by using approximately 879,000 spectral responses from hyperspectral images of clean chicken breast fillets in the near-infrared wavelength range of 1000\u20131700 nm. Testing involved 30 different types of FMs commonly found in processing plants, prepared in two nominal sizes: 2 \u00d7 2 mm2 and 5 \u00d7 5 mm2. The FM-detection technique achieved impressive results at both the spectral pixel level and the foreign material object level. At the spectral pixel level, the model achieved a precision of 100%, a recall of over 93%, an F1 score of 96.8%, and a balanced accuracy of 96.9%. When combining the rich 1D spectral data with 2D spatial information, the FM-detection accuracy at the object level reached 96.5%. In summary, the impressive results obtained through this study demonstrate its effectiveness at accurately identifying and localizing FMs. Furthermore, the technique\u2019s potential for generalization and application to other agriculture and food-related domains highlights its broader significance.

Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a widely advocated water management practice to achieve lower As concentrations in rice, water savings, and decreased methane emissions. It is not yet clear whether AWD leads to tradeoffs between grain As concentration and concentrations of micronutrient (e.g., zinc, manganese, molybdenum) trace elements. We analyzed pore water chemistry and rice grain composition data from a field experiment conducted in Arkansas, in 2017 and 2018 to test the hypothesis that AWD will have diverging effects on oxyanion-forming (arsenic, molybdenum) vs. cationic (cadmium, zinc, manganese, copper) trace elements. This was hypothesized to occur via decreases in soil pH and/or precipitation of iron oxide minerals during oxidizing conditions. Solubility of all trace elements, except zinc, increased in more reducing conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, AWD tended to increase grain concentrations of cationic elements while decreasing grain concentrations of oxyanionic elements. Decreases in total As under AWD were mainly driven by changes in dimethylarsinic concentrations, with negligible changes in inorganic As. Linear mixed-effects modeling showed that effects of AWD on grain composition were more significant in 2017 compared to 2018. These differences may be related to the timing of dry-downs in the growth cycle of rice plants, with dry-downs during heading stage of rice leading to larger impacts on grain composition of multiple elements. We also observed significant interannual variability in grain elemental composition from continuously flooded fields and postulate the warmer night temperature in 2018 may have played a role in these differences.", "publication_date": "2023-08-07", "date_other": "", "volume": 45, "issue": 11, "first_page": 8135, "last_page": 8151, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20403741%20-%20Abu-Ali%20et%20al.%202023.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 434318, "log_number": 403741, "created": 1694174060, "changed": 1711120639}, {"submission_node_id": 691, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Mormon crickets aggregate and march in bands containing millions of insects. Some bands are comprised of insects seeking proteins. They are also low in circulating phenoloxidase (PO) and more susceptible to fungal attack, as we have demonstrated in the lab. Here, we ask: Do Mormon crickets elevate PO and consume protein in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana? B. bassiana was applied topically (day 0), and mortality began on day 5. Total protein, PO, and prophenoloxidase (proPO) were assayed in hemolymph on day 1 and 4. On day 1, PO titers were not different between inoculated and control insects, whereas by day 4, PO was greater in the inoculated group. proPO activity was unchanged. Circulating protein declined in inoculated insects relative to controls. As predicted, PO titers were elevated as a result of fungal infection, and hemolymph protein was reduced, but the insects did not compensate behaviorally. Indeed, during the first three days post-infection, infected insects reduced protein consumption while maintaining carbohydrate consumption similar to the controls. Following day 3, a more general reduction in protein and carbohydrate intake was evident in infected insects. Survivorship to infection was associated with the amount of protein consumed and unrelated to carbohydrate consumption. Selective protein deprivation by the host seems counterintuitive, but it might limit growth and toxin production by the invading fungus. Alternatively, the fungus might control the host diet to compromise host immunity to infection. Abrupt changes in allocation resulting from an infection can lead to changes in acquisition that are not always intuitive. Because protein acquisition drives aggression between members of the migratory band, B. bassiana application may reduce cannibalism and slow band movement.", "publication_date": "2023-09-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 149, "issue": "", "first_page": 104555, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20405454%20-%20Srygley_JRNL%20Insect%20Physiology%202023_149_104555.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 439261, "log_number": 405454, "created": 1694174048, "changed": 1711120591}, {"submission_node_id": 689, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

The effective population size (\ud835\ude15\ud835\ude26) was approximately 200. The pedigree contained 440,000 animals, and approximately 16,800 individuals were genotyped.

We evaluated quadratic and nonlinear SNP weights in addition to the unweighted G. The inclusion of QTN to panels led to significant accuracy gains. Nonlinear A was demonstrated to be superior to quadratic weighting and unweighted approaches; however, results from Nonlinear A were dependent on the equation parameters. The unweighted approach was more suitable for less polygenic scenarios. Finally, SNP weighting might help elucidate trait architecture features based on changes in the accuracy of genomic prediction.

We conducted five experiments over four years with a diverse set of nearly 500 lettuce accessions to evaluate their response to the pathogen in an artificially infested field. The lowest disease incidence (DI) was observed in cultivars Eruption, Infantry, and Annapolis (median DI of 12.1 - 17.5%), while the highest DI was recorded for cultivars Reine des Glaces, Wayahead, and line FL. 43007 (median DI of 81.0 - 95.2%).

Genome-wide association mapping identified 17 QTLs for resistance to S. minor, 12 for the presence of red leaf color or its variations caused by the anthocyanin content, and one for the green color intensity. Eight of the QTLs for disease resistance and red color co-located. The frequent co-location of QTLs, together with the lower DI observed in red and dark red accessions implies a causal relationship between anthocyanin content and resistance to S. minor.

In response to aphid attack, host plant initiates a large transcriptional reorganization, leading to activation of the host defense genes in aphid-attacked plants. In this study, our objective was to analyze defensive responses of sorghum against aphid and identify aphid resistance genes in sorghum. For the experiments, seedlings developed from an aphid resistant germplasm line (PI 550607) were divided into two groups, then, one group was infested with greenbug ((\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2e Rondani) and the other group was used as control (un-infested). In addition, seedlings of sorghum cultivar Tx 7000, a susceptible genotype, prepared under the same conditions, were used as a genetic control. Those plant samples were used to develop transcriptional profiles using the microarray method, from which 26.1% of the 1,761 cDNA sequences spotted on the microarray showed altered expression between two treatments at 4\u00a0days after infestation. Sequence annotation and molecular analysis revealed that many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to direct host defense or signal transduction pathways, which regulate host defense. In addition to common responsive genes, unique transcripts were identified in response to greenbug infestation specifically. Later, a similar transcriptional profiling was conducted using the RNA-seq method, resulted in the identification of 2,856 DEGs in the resistant line with a comparison between infested and non-infested at 4\u00a0days and 4,354 DEGs in the resistant genotype compared to the susceptible genotype at 4\u00a0days. Based on the comparative analysis, the data of RNA-seq provided a support for the results from the microarray study as it was noticed that many of the DEGs are common in both platforms. Analysis of the two differential expression profiles indicate that aphid triggered dynamic defense responses in sorghum plants and sorghum plant defense against aphid is a complex process involving both general defense systems and specific resistance mechanisms. Finally, the results of the study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying host plant defense against aphids and will help us design better strategies for effectively controlling aphid pest.

The lowest number of thrips larvae (1.96 and 3.85) and adults (0.00 and 0.00) were recorded when treated with dual application of \ud835\ude09. \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22 and spinetoram at 7\u2009days post application (DPA) after the second spray application in 2017and 2018, respectively. Damage on onion plants was considerably decreased in all treatments relative to the control. The lowest damage was observed on onion plants treated with \ud835\ude09. \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22\u2009+\u2009spinetoram at 7\u2009DPA after the second spray application during both years. A significant decrease in the number of natural enemies (beetles, spiders, mites, lacewings, ants and bugs) on onion plants was recorded during both years. Insect pathogens when applied alone and in combination with each other considerably protected arthropod natural enemies compared to insecticide application applied alone. Significant increase in plant agronomic traits was observed compared to the control. Among all the treatments, \ud835\ude09. \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22\u2009+\u2009spinetoram produced maximum leaf length, leaf weight, total leaves, neck diameter, bulb diameter, number of rings per bulb, bulb weight, dry matter and plant yield following the 2017and 2018 applications, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study reveal the potential of using insect pathogens and insecticide for control of \ud835\ude1b. \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a. However, combinations containing spinetoram are harmful to nontarget organisms, whereas biological control agents help in protecting biodiversity in onion agroecosystems. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Alternative methods to control this pest are needed to reduce insecticide use, including new repellents. Previous research demonstrated that D. suzukii adults use odor cues to avoid blueberries infected with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae, which causes the disease anthracnose. To identify novel D. suzukii repellents, we investigated the volatile emission from experimentally-infected fruit, which were inoculated with C. fioriniae isolates in the laboratory, and from field-collected fruit, which were naturally infected and harvested from a field. We then tested the pathogen-induced volatiles on D. suzukii adult behavior. RESULTS: Volatile emission was similar between all five C. fioriniae strains, with good agreement between experimentally-infected and field-collected berries. In total, 14 volatiles were found to be more abundant in infected versus uninfected fruit headspace. In multiple-choice bioassays, nine of the 14 volatiles elicited repellency responses from adult D. suzukii. These nine volatiles were further evaluated in dual choice assays, where all nine reduced fly capture by 43\u201396% compared to the control. The most repellent compounds tested were the esters ethyl butanoate and ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate, which were more or equally repellent to the known D. suzukii repellents 1-octen-3-ol, geosmin, and 2-pentylfuran. Dose\u2013response assays identified concentration-dependent effects on D. suzukii repellency and oviposition when applied individually and consistent aversion observed across doses of a 1:1 blend.  CONCLUSION: We report two repellents from C. fioriniae-infected blueberries that could be useful semiochemicals for the behavioral manipulation of D. suzukii in the field. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

The objective of this study was to develop a mass-balanced process model based on a pilot-scale aquaponics facility growing Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) in Auburn, Alabama. This enabled a better understanding of how key elements partition among different downstream processes, ultimately affecting nutrients available to plants or discharged to the environment. Data were collected from a pilot scale decoupled aquaponics system for a full calendar year and included weekly water quality, direct GHG emissions, and water flows. Bio-solids, fish mass, and plant mass were also quantified and underwent elemental analysis. Together, these measurements were used to create stoichiometric equations for mass partitioning. The resulting stoichiometry was used to develop a mass-balanced process model constructed in SuperPro Designer software. Four separate variations of the model were developed, one for each season. The model showed that 21.6% of input nitrogen was assimilated by tilapia and only 2.81% by plants, while 33% of input phosphorus was assimilated by tilapia and 2.6% by plants. Modeled effluent concentrations of nitrate from the fish tank, clarifier, and plants averaged 440, 441, and 307 mg L-1, respectively, compared to average measured values of 442, 406, and 298 mg L-1. Modeled effluent phosphate concentrations from the fish tank, clarifier, and plants were 25, 27, and 20 mg L-1 of phosphate, respectively, over the course of one year, while average measured values were 30, 31, and 26 mg L-1.

These interactions depend upon and influence geologic and geomorphic processes, the chemical composition of constituents, and biological activities of microbes, higher organisms and associated ecological communities. All these components of the critical zone are co-evolving through inter-dependencies that extend over various space and time scales. In intensively managed agricultural landscapes, critical zone interactions are extensively disrupted to facilitate agro-ecosystem services. However, such disruptions are not evenly distributed across the landscape. Our research, conducted over eight years at the Intensively Managed Landscapes Critical Zone Observatory, demonstrates that the dynamics of intensively managed critical zones do not operate uniformly across time and space. Instead, critical interfaces, or zones of transition between different aspects of the landscape system, play a disproportionately important role in regulating material fluxes through mechanisms of storage, transport, and transformation, often through threshold responses and intermittent connectivity across these interfaces. We provide insight into how critical interfaces affect the intricate dynamics of water, energy, carbon, nutrients, and sediment in intensively managed landscapes. Since anthropogenic activities are continually and extensively modifying critical interfaces, sound understanding of the impact of these modifications is essential for intensive management to also be sustainable management.", "publication_date": "2023-09-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 244, "issue": "", "first_page": 104543, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20398391%20-%20CZO%20interfaces.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 434395, "log_number": 398391, "created": 1694173973, "changed": 1711118218}, {"submission_node_id": 657, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

In all, 12 ruminally cannulated cows were assigned to diets with high or low RDP levels. Within each RDP level, molasses was substituted for corn grain at a concentration of 0%, 5.25%, or 10.5% of diet dry matter in a replicated 3 \u00d7 3 Latin square design with 28-day periods. Liquid and solid rumen digesta fractions collected at the end of each period underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify operational taxonomic units and were analyzed for short-chain fatty acids. Protein degradability affected 6 bacterial genera, whereas carbohydrate alteration impacted 13 genera (p &lt; 0.05). Of the 30 genera with the highest relative abundance, 26 differed by digesta fraction (p &lt; 0.05), with Bacteroidetes genera showing a greater abundance in solids and Firmicutes genera demonstrating a greater prevalence in liquids. Regarding relative abundances, with increasing molasses, Succiniclasticum decreased in liquid (p &lt; 0.05), and CF231, YRC22, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, BF311, and Oscillospira increased in solids (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, at higher RDP levels, Succiniclasticum increased while YRC22 and Pseudobutyrivibrio decreased in solids (p &lt; 0.05). Genera with abundances found to be correlated with fermentation products in the liquid included Shuttleworthia, Treponema, Lachnospira, and Schwartzia, which typically have lower relative abundances, showing strong positive correlations with molar proportions (mol%) of propionate, butyrate, and valerate (p &lt; 0.05), and negative correlations with pH and acetate mol% (p &lt; 0.05). Fibrobacter was positively correlated with lactate mol% (p &lt; 0.05). Butyrate mol% exhibited a quadratic increase as molasses increased (p = 0.017), and lactate mol% rose with increased RDP levels (p = 0.042). No treatment effects were detected for pH propionate and valerate mol%; however, we observed a tendency (p = 0.075) for a quadratic effect of molasses treatment on the mol% of acetate.

Despite many potential benefits, Lewis flax remains minimally explored as an agronomic crop. Determining agronomic best practices for producing economically relevant stands of Lewis flax is critical to its adoption as an oilseed crop. Several aspects of Lewis flax agronomic production were explored through the lens of adaptive management between 2020 and 2022. Initial field trials aimed at assessing spring-seeded Lewis flax row spacing, plant population density, and intercropping strategies with legumes and grasses failed due to poor establishment. Heavy rains and excessive weed pressure further complicated attempts to reestablish these initial trials. We established additional Lewis flax plots via fall and dormant seeding in response to the failure of our first experiment. This second experiment focused on exploring row spacing, population density, and seeding timing impacts on flax production. Flax yield did not differ among our treatments, averaging 59 kg ha\u207b\u00b9. The low yields realized by our field trials may be due to several factors including need for harvest technology optimization, high weed pressure, and need for Lewis flax genetic improvement. Our study is a first step toward developing recommendations for optimal production strategies for Lewis flax in an agronomic context. Continued exploration of methods to improve management and yield of Lewis flax will be critical to its successful development as an agronomic crop.

Meteoric water lines (MWLs) are used to interpret hydrologic processes, though equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes affect the linear function and can reveal seasonal and climatological effects, necessitating the development of local meteoric water lines (LMWLs). At RCEW\u2010CZO, an RCEW LMWL was developed using non\u2010volume\u2010weighted, orthogonal regression with assumed error in both predictor and response variables from several years of precipitation (2015, 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2021) primarily at three different elevations (1203, 1585, and 2043\u00a0m). As most precipitation is evaporated or intercepted by vegetation in the driest months, an RCEW LMWL for groundwater recharge (RCEW LMWL\u2010GWR) was also developed using precipitation from the wettest months (November through April).

Since aMPV-A was initially reported in Mexico in 2014, there have been no additional reports of its detection in the country. Using nontargeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of FTA card-spotted respiratory samples from commercial chickens in Mexico, seven full genome sequences of aMPV-A (lengths of 13,288\u201313,381 nucleotides) were de novo assembled. Additionally, complete coding sequences of genes N (n = 2), P and M (n = 7 each), F and L (n = 1 each), M2 (n = 6), SH (n = 5) and G (n = 2) were reference-based assembled from another seven samples. The Mexican isolates phylogenetically group with, but in a distinct clade separate from, other aMPV-A strains. The genome and G-gene nt sequences of the Mexican aMPVs are closest to strain UK/8544/06 (97.22\u201397.47% and 95.07\u201395.83%, respectively). Various amino acid variations distinguish the Mexican isolates from each other, and other aMPV-A strains, most of which are in the G (n = 38), F (n = 12), and L (n = 19) proteins. Using our sequence data and publicly available aMPV-A data, we revised a previously published rRT-PCR test, which resulted in different cycling and amplification conditions for aMPV-A to make it more compatible with other commonly used rRT-PCR diagnostic cycling conditions. This is the first comprehensive sequence analysis of aMPVs in Mexico and demonstrates the value of nontargeted NGS to identify pathogens where targeted virus surveillance is likely not routinely performed.", "publication_date": "2022-10-19", "date_other": "", "volume": 9, "issue": 10, "first_page": 579, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20396110%20-%20VetSci%202022%20aMPV-A%20in%20Mexico.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437327, "changed": 1711117753}, {"submission_node_id": 228, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

However, improper use of these ecosystems can degrade their soils and their C storage capacity. Specifically, prolonged high stocking rates in livestock production can result in significantly less soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil fertility in grazing lands. This underlines the need to assess key soil health indicators to determine the ecological efficacy of grazing management. The objective of this study was to identify the impacts of alternative grazing management practices, including heavy continuous (HC), light continuous (LC), and adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing, on SOC and soil health indicators at the ranch and watershed scales in the Lower Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River Watershed in Northwest Texas. The stocking rate was the same under AMP and HC grazing, and it was reduced by half under LC grazing. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Carbon (SWAT-C) model was modified and used to conduct this assessment over a 40 year period (1979-2018), after a 900-year spin-up simulation (800 years under natural condition and 100 years under the HC grazing) to initiate the SOC pool. The simulated SOC was validated using observed data from several sampling locations. The study results indicated that when grazing management at the study ranch was changed from the current AMP grazing to hypothetical HC grazing, simulated average annual SOC decreased from 84 to 81.8 Mg/ha (a 2.6% decline). At the watershed-scale, when the grazing management was changed from the baseline HC grazing to AMP grazing, the simulated average annual SOC increased from 35.6 to 38.3 Mg/ha (a 7.5% increase). The net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), biomass C, and soil nitrogen (N) increased, while C losses from runoff, and sediment loads decreased under AMP grazing. These results indicate that compared to HC, AMP grazing performed better with respect to SOC increase, and improvement of soil ecosystem and hydrological functions at both the ranch and watershed scales in the study watershed. Our findings suggest the need to shift from continuous to AMP grazing in order to improve soil health at multiple spatial scales.", "publication_date": "2023-02-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 342, "issue": "", "first_page": 108234, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20397460%20-%20397460_published%20manu.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437316, "changed": 1711117661}, {"submission_node_id": 226, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

The cowpea landrace B301 was previously identified as a source of Alectra resistance, but neither the genes nor genomic loci conferring this resistance have been mapped. Therefore, to map and identify genetic markers linked to Alectra resistance for use in the molecular improvement of cowpea, we developed an F2 population from a cross of the susceptible variety 524B with B301. The population was phenotyped for resistance to A. vogelii and genotyped with a cowpea high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. Putative resistance loci were mapped in F2 populations by categorical trait\u2013multiple interval mapping and validated by selective genotyping. Selective genotyping indicated that the resistance loci on Vu04 (Rav1) and Vu11 (Rav2) were significantly associated with resistance (p \u2264 0.01). Using marker assisted backcrossing, the two resistance loci were introgressed independently into the susceptible 524B genetic background. Phenotyping and genotyping of the segregating backcross families delineated Rav1 to a 10 cM on chromosome 4 and Rav2 to a 6.7 cM interval in chromosome 11.

Two bulks of progenies were then constructed, one consisted of 27 highly smut resistant progenies and the other 24 smut susceptible progenies. Total RNAs of the progenies of each bulk, were pooled and subject to bulked segregant RNA-sequence analysis (BSR-Seq). A total of 164.44 Gb clean data containing 2,341,449 SNPs and 64,999 genes were obtained, 7,295 of which were differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were mainly enriched in stress-related metabolic pathways, including carbon metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, glutathione metabolism, and plant-pathogen interactions. Besides, 45,946 high-quality, credible SNPs, a 1.27 Mb region at Saccharum spontaneum chromosome Chr5B (68,904,827 to 70,172,982), and 129 candidate genes were identified to be associated with smut resistance.

Finally, a potential molecular mechanism of sugarcane and S. scitamineum interaction is depicted that activations of MAPK cascade signaling, ROS signaling, Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling, and PAL metabolic pathway and initiation of the glyoxalase system jointly promote the resistance to S. scitamineum in sugarcane.

Therefore, development of drought tolerant cultivars, lower input turf management strategies that sustains turfgrass appearance and performance with less irrigation water, and tolerance to higher seasonal temperatures will be critically important.

For better utilization, it is important to assess protein quality accurately and cost-effectively. For decades, several indirect indices have been relied on, including nitrogen solubility index, protein dispersibility index, urease activity, and protein solubility in 0.2% potassium hydroxide. However, each existing index has limitations or practical difficulties for measurement, while different procedures and terminologies often cause confusion. For rectifying this situation, a new protein quality index, the protein solubility index (PSI), was developed. This required investigation of many factors, including alkali hydroxide type and concentration, solid to solvent ratio, extraction time, magnetic stirring speed, magnetic stirrer type, and centrifugation force and time. For nitrogen analysis, a combustion method was used, where effects of using extracts or residues, sample moisture, sample mass, and the sequence of drying and weighing residues were also investigated. The new PSI method employs 5 mM alkali hydroxide extraction, magnetic stirring, nitrogen analysis of dried residues and small sample size. It allows simultaneous running of multiple samples. Furthermore, the correlations between trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) and PSI were either strong or very strong (r = 0.747**-0.974**), depending on sample sets. The 5 mM extraction procedure produced a stronger correlation between protein extractability and TIA than the extraction procedure for the TIA assay (10 mM NaOH, 3 hr).

Using 300 advanced breeding lines from North Dakota State University (NDSU) pulse breeding program and \u223c200 USDA accessions that were evaluated for 10 nutritional traits, our results show that the proposed sparse phenotyping aided MT-GS can further improve predictive ability by &gt;12% across traits compared with univariate (UNI) genomic selection. The proposed strategy departed from the previous reports that weak genetic correlation is a limitation to the advantage of MT-GS over UNI genomic selection, which was evident in the partially balanced phenotyping-enabled MT-GS. Our results point to heritability and genetic correlation between traits as possible metrics to optimize and further improve the estimation of model parameters, and ultimately, prediction performance. Overall, our study offers a new approach to optimize the prediction performance using the MT-GS and further highlight strategy to maximize the efficiency of GS in a plant breeding program. The sparse-testing-aided MT-GS proposed in this study can be further extended to multi-environment, multi-trait GS to improve prediction performance and further reduce the cost of phenotyping and time-consuming data collection process.", "publication_date": "2022-10-03", "date_other": "", "volume": 15, "issue": 4, "first_page": "e20260", "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20393416%20-%20Multi%20trait%20genomic%202022.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437305, "changed": 1711116557}, {"submission_node_id": 214, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

Except for SbCYP79A1, aldoxime biosynthetic enzymes in the cereal sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) have not been characterized. This study identified nine CYP79-encoding genes in the genome of sorghum. A phylogenetic analysis of CYP79 showed that SbCYP79A61 formed a subclade with maize ZmCYP79A61, previously characterized to be involved in aldoxime biosynthesis. Functional characterization of this sorghum enzyme using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and stable overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that SbCYP79A61 catalyzes the production of phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx) from phenylalanine but, unlike the maize enzyme, displays no detectable activity against tryptophan. Additionally, targeted metabolite analysis after stable isotope feeding assays revealed that PAOx can serve as a precursor of phenylacetic acid (PAA) in sorghum and identified benzyl cyanide as an intermediate of PAOx-derived PAA biosynthesis in both sorghum and maize. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SbCYP79A61 produces PAOx in sorghum and may serve in the biosynthesis of other nitrogen-containing phenylalanine-derived metabolites involved in mediating biotic and abiotic stresses.", "publication_date": "2023-01-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 74, "issue": 1, "first_page": 364, "last_page": 376, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20393190%20-%20JXB%202022%20perez_online.pdf", "manuscript_version": "accepted_manuscript", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437303, "changed": 1711116359}, {"submission_node_id": 213, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

As bloom progressed, microbe abundance and diversity increased, regardless of kingdom, floral tissue type, or management strategy. The magnitude in which microbial abundance and diversity were affected varied considerably, however, with host proximity to apiaries and orchard management having notable effects on bacteria and fungi, respectively. 4.

Little information regarding the molecular basis of winter survivability and drought resistance in African bermudagrass is available.

A total of 109 first-generation self-pollinated (S\u2081) progeny of C. transvaalensis \u2018OKC1163\u2019 were evaluated in a field trial in a randomized complete block design with three replications for four seasons. Significant genetic variation existed for all the traits examined, and the broad-sense heritability estimates ranged from 0.36 to 0.52 for the winter survival traits and was 0.81 for LF. Eight QTL were identified for winter survivability and two for LF in analyzing the phenotypic data on a preexisting high-density linkage map. Six of the 10 QTL were consistently identified at least in two environments. The co-location of two QTL, one for winter survival and another for LF suggests the possibility of improving both traits together.

An interest to grow cover crops in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems has been increasing in the Texas Rolling Plains (TRP) region. However, due to limited rainfall and groundwater availability, producers in this semi-arid region are concerned that winter cover crops can reduce soil water availability for a subsequent cotton crop. In addition, the long-term effects of cover crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) not well studied in this region. The overall goal of this study was to assess the long-term effects of growing a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cover crop on soil water, SOC, seed cotton yield, and crop water productivity (CWP) under irrigated and dryland cotton production systems using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Measured data from cover crop experiments conducted at the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe from 2011 to 2020 were used to evaluate the CROPGRO-Cotton and CERES-Wheat modules in the DSSAT Cropping System Model. The average percent error (PE) between the simulated and measured seed cotton yield was 0.3% and -0.9%, and that between the simulated and measured aboveground wheat biomass was 1.4% and -3.4% during the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively. For the simulation of SOC, the PE was 8.5% and 7.6% during the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively. Long-term (2001-2020) simulations showed that soil water was reduced substantially by winter wheat cover crop before its termination. However, depleted soil water was quickly replenished by spring precipitation and maintained at a higher level during the cotton growing season. Winter wheat cover crops can potentially improve SOC in irrigated and dryland cotton production systems. The CWP of cotton also improved with a winter wheat cover crop under both irrigated and dryland conditions. We concluded that cover crops could potentially improve soil health and provide a sustainable environment for TRP cotton production.", "publication_date": "2022-08-11", "date_other": "", "volume": 65, "issue": 5, "first_page": 1163, "last_page": 1177, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20391055%20-%202022_Himanshu_et_al-2022-Journal_of_ASABE_Cover_crop_impacts_DSSAT_study.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437284, "changed": 1711115486}, {"submission_node_id": 204, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

Although previous efforts based on multiple molecular markers or genome-wide SNPs supported the monophyly of Carya and its two EA and NA major subclades, the maternal phylogeny of Carya still need to be comprehensively evaluated. The variation of Carya plastome has never been thoroughly characterized. Here, we novelly present 19 newly generated plastomes of congeneric Carya species, including the recently rediscovered critically endangered C. poilanei. The overall assessment of plastomes revealed highly conservative in the general structures. Our results indicated that remarkable differences in several plastome features are highly consistent with the EA-NA disjunction and showed the relatively diverse matrilineal sources among EA Carya compared to NA Carya. The maternal phylogenies were conducted with different plastome regions and full-length plastome datasets from 30 plastomes, representing 26 species in six genera of Juglandoideae and Myrica rubra (as root). Six out of seven phylogenetic topologies strongly supported the previously reported relationships among genera of Juglandoideae and the two subclades of EA and NA Carya, but displayed significant incongruencies between species within the EA and NA subclades. The phylogenetic tree generated from full-length plastomes demonstrated the optimal topology and revealed significant geographical maternal relationships among Carya species, especially for EA Carya within overlapping distribution areas. The full-length plastome-based phylogenetic topology also strongly supported the taxonomic status of five controversial species as separate species of Carya. Historical and recent introgressive hybridization and plastid captures might contribute to plastome geographic patterns and inconsistencies between topologies built from different datasets, while incomplete lineage sorting could account for the discordance between maternal topology and the previous nuclear genome data-based phylogeny.

Some of these accessions have fruit phenotypes that suggest recent M. domestica admixture, which if true would represent crop contamination of wild species populations and mislabeled species status of NPGS accessions. Pedigree connections and admixture among M. domestica and its progenitor species can be readily identified with apple SNP array data, despite such arrays not being designed for these purposes. To investigate species purity, most (463 accessions) of the NPGS accessions labeled as these three progenitor species were genotyped using the 20K apple SNP array.

Only 212 accessions (151 M. sieversii, 26 M. orientalis, and 35 M. sylvestris) were identified as \u201cpure\u201d species representatives because their DNA profiles did not exhibit genotypic signatures of recent admixture with M. domestica. Twenty-one accessions (17 M. sieversii, 1 M. orientalis, and 3 M. sylvestris) previously labeled as wild species were instead fully M. domestica.

Species identification was confirmed through molecular identification, sequencing two to six gene regions per isolate, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses were used to identify novel species.

The novel species Cadophora columbiana, Cytospora macropycnidia, Cytospora yakimana, and Sporocadus incarnatus are formally described, four species are newly reported from North America, and grape is reported as a new host for three species. Six species were shared between the two regions: Cytospora viticola, Diatrype stigma, Diplodia seriata, Kalmusia variispora, Phaeoacremonium minimum, and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora. Dominating the species community in Washington wine-grape vineyards were species in the fungal families Diatrypaceae, Cytosporaceae and Sporocadaceae, whereas in California table-grape vineyards, the dominant species were in the families Diatrypaceae, Togniniaceae, Phaeomoniellaceae and Hymenochaetaceae. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that 10 isolates cause wood discoloration similar to symptomatic wood they were isolated from originally.

In this study, the CYPome (an omics term for all the CYP genes in a genome) diversification was examined in the four Tenebrionidea species through genome-wide analysis. A total of 483 CYP genes were identified, of which 103, 157, 122, and 101 were respectively deciphered from the genomes of Tebebrio molitor, Asbolus verucosus, Hycleus cichorii and Hycleus phaleratus.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that most CYPs of these Tenebrionidea beetles from each clan had a very close 1:1 orthology to each other, suggesting that they originate closely and have evolutionally conserved function. Expression analysis at different developmental stages and in various tissues showed the life stage-, gut-, salivary gland-, fat body-, Malpighian tubule-, antennae-, ovary- and testis-specific expression patterns of T. molitor CYP genes, implying their various potential roles in development, detoxification, immune response, digestion, olfaction, and reproduction.

In this study, for retention of meat quality while assuring microbial food safety, mild levels of high hydrostatic pressure were hurdled with food-grade additives (i.e., allyl isothiocyanate [AITC] and acetic acid [AA], functioned as antimicrobials) to inactivate pathogenic Escherichia coli in ground chicken. The reductions of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O157:H7 and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) were described as a function of high hydrostatic pressure (200\u2013350 MPa), process-holding time (10\u201325 min), AITC concentration (0.05\u20130.20% w/w), and AA concentration (0.10-\u20130.30% w/w) using a full factorial design. The antimicrobials had little influence on bacterial inactivation without high pressure. Without the antimicrobials, a high-pressure treatment at 300 MPa and 4\u00b0C for 15 min reduced E. coli O157:H7 and UPEC by 1.52 and 2.52 log, respectively. A 5-log reduction was achieved when AITC and AA were combined with high pressure, indicating a synergistic effect. The survivors were further reduced to below the detection limit of 1 log CFU/g after subsequent storage tests at 4 and 10\u00b0C for 10 days. The STEC O157:H7 was found slightly more resistant than UPEC in our test matrix. The developed models showed good fits with experimental data (R\u00b2 &gt; 0.95 for linear models; Pr &gt; F (&lt;0.0001) for dimensionless nonlinear models); which may help processors find/optimize the processing parameters to achieve target foodborne pathogens reduction for food safety requirement.  Practical Application: Models were developed to predict the inactivation of pathogenic Escherichia coli in ground chicken by high-pressure processing (HPP) in combination with natural antimicrobial compounds. These models can be used to estimate/determine the HPP operation parameters and antimicrobial usage levels (i.e., allyl isothiocyanate and acetic acid) needed to achieve a specific microbial log reduction within the selected factor ranges.

An O. nivara (IRGC104443) accession, previously identified as being moderately resistant to rice sheath blight disease, was used as the donor parent to develop an advanced backcross population with the U.S. rice (O. sativa) cultivar, LaGrue, as the recurrent parent. The population was genotyped with 210 DNA markers and a linkage map constructed that spanned 1488.9 cM. Sheath blight (ShB) disease was evaluated in both greenhouse and field conditions. Days to heading (DTHD), plant height (PTHT) and culm (angle) habit (CULMHAB) were recorded because they can confound sheath blight disease ratings under field conditions. Multiple interval mapping identified qShB9 as the ShB-QTL being the source of resistance and the resistance was attributed to the O. nivara allele. The single CULMHAB QTL, qCULMHAB9, was also located in this region but had a different peak suggesting the more open tillering habit was most likely due to the tiller angle control-1 gene which was fine-mapped near the chromosome 9 sheath blight resistance in other O. sativa populations. The ShB QTL, qShB3-2, identified in the greenhouse study was not verified in field studies. None of the three DTHD QTL were colocalized with ShB QTL, while the single PTHT QTL was mapped to the region of the semi-dwarf-1 gene for short stature on chromosome 1. These results indicate that sheath blight resistance QTL can be selected that are independent of delayed heading and tall plant height ,the traits that are associated with disease escape but are undesirable in cultivated rice.

Pheromone mating disruption using timed aerosol dispensers is an increasingly common management technique. Dispenser efficiency may be increased by timing releases with the active mating period of navel orangeworm. Past work found that the peak time of sexual activity for navel orangeworm females is 2 hours before sunrise when temperatures are above 18\u00b0 C. Inference of male responsiveness from data collected in that study was limited by the necessity of using laboratory-reared females as a source of sex pheromone emission to attract males and the inherent limitations of human observers for nocturnal events. Here we used camera traps baited with artificial pheromone to observe male navel orangeworm mating response in the field over two field seasons. Male response to synthetic pheromone exhibited diel patterns broadly similar to females, i.e., they were active for a brief period of 2 to 3 hours before dawn under summer conditions and began responding to pheromone earlier and over a longer period of time during spring and fall. But contrary to the previous findings with females, some males were captured at all hours of the day and night, and there was no evidence of short-term change of pheromone responsiveness in response to temperature. Environmental effects on the response of navel orangeworm males to an artificial pheromone source differs in important ways from the environmental effects on female release of sex pheromone.", "publication_date": "2022-09-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 22, "issue": 5, "first_page": 11, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20396687%20-%20ieac059.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437264, "changed": 1711113337}, {"submission_node_id": 185, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

In Ecdysozoa, neuropeptides and their G-protein-coupled receptors play a critical integrative role in the regulation of all physiological processes. However, the physiological activity of many neuropeptides is still unknown in ticks. Periviscerokinins (CAP2b/PVKs) are neuropeptides associated with myotropic and diuretic activities in insects. These peptides have been identified only in a few tick species, such as Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis and R. microplus, and their cognate receptor only characterized for the last two. Methods: Expression of the periviscerokinin receptor (Rhimi-CAP2bR) was investigated throughout the developmental stages of R. microplus and silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in the females. In a first experiment, three double-stranded (ds) RNAs, named ds680-805, ds956-1109 and ds1102-1200, respectively, were tested in vivo. All three caused phenotypic effects, but only the last one was chosen for subsequent experiments. Resulting RNAi phenotypic variables were compared to those of negative controls, both non-injected and dsRNA beta-lactamase-injected ticks, and to positive controls injected with beta-actin dsRNA. Rhimi-CAP2bR silencing was verified by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR in whole females and dissected tissues. Results: Rhimi-CAP2bR transcript expression was detected throughout all developmental stages. Rhimi-CAP2bR silencing was associated with increased female mortality, decreased weight of surviving females and of egg masses, a delayed egg incubation period and decreased egg hatching (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Conclusions: CAP2b/PVKs appear to be associated with the regulation of female feeding, reproduction and survival. Since the Rhimi-CAP2bR loss of function was detrimental to females, the discovery of antagonistic molecules of the CAP2b/PVK signaling system should cause similar effects.

Here, we present a proofreading-impaired Pol mutant (Y547S) of Marek\u2019s disease virus that exhibits a hypermutator phenotype while maintaining unimpaired growth in vitro and wild-type (WT)-like pathogenicity in vivo. At the same time, mutation frequencies observed in Y547S virus populations are 2\u20135-fold higher compared to the parental WT virus. We find that Y547S adapts faster to growth in originally non-permissive cells, evades pressure conferred by antiviral inhibitors more efficiently, and is more easily attenuated by serial passage in cultured cells compared to WT. Our results suggest that hypermutator viruses can serve as a tool to accelerate evolutionary processes and help identify key genetic changes required for adaptation to novel host cells and resistance to antiviral therapy.

However, irrigation scheduling decisions utilize daily ET\u2090 estimates, hence the need for time scaling. This study evaluated different upscaling methods to calculate daily maize ET\u2090 using one-time-of day T\u1d63 under varying water stress conditions. Mobile IRTs were mounted on a high clearance mobile sensing platform and collected T\u1d63 in remote locations under full, deficit and rainfed conditions. Seven scaling methods via two pathways were employed to obtain daily ET\u2090. First pathway was scaling one-time-of-day T\u1d63 (SC) whereas the second pathway involved use of six upscaling methods of instantaneous ET\u2090 including: original and modified evaporative factor ((EF)\u2092, (EF)\u2098) as well as crop coefficient ((K\ud835\udcb8)\u2092, (K\ud835\udcb8)\u2098), direct canopy resistance (Direct- r\ud835\udcb8), and solar radiation ratio (R\u2099/R\u209b); and all were compared to a neutron-based soil water balance (SWB) determined ET\u2090. From the results, SC outperformed other methods in comparison to SWB ET\u2090 across all the selected treatments with smaller discrepancies and lower RMSE (0.9\u20131.7 mm d\u207b\u00b9 vs. 0.7\u20134.3 mm d\u207b\u00b9 for other methods). Furthermore, methods including SC, (EF)\u2092, (EF)\u2098, and R\u2099/R\u209b had their daily average ET\u2090 values in close agreement to SWB ET\u2090 with mean ET\u2090 differences ranging between 0.2 and 1.6 mm d\u207b\u00b9. Overall, SC method performed better in fully irrigated maize (r\u00b2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.9 mm d\u207b\u00b9) than in deficit irrigated maize ( r\u00b2 = 0.48, RMSE = 1.4 mm d\u22121) but worst in rainfed maize (r\u00b2 = 0.16, RMSE = 1.7 mm d\u207b\u00b9).

However, evolution of resistance to Bt toxins by pests diminishes the efficacy of Bt crops. Resistance to crystalline (Cry) Bt toxins has spurred adoption of crops genetically engineered to produce the Bt vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3Aa. Here we used laboratory diet bioassays to evaluate responses to Vip3Aa by pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), one of the world&#039;s most damaging pests of cotton. RESULTS: Against pink bollworm larvae susceptible to Cry toxins, Vip3Aa was less potent than Cry1Ac or Cry2Ab. Conversely, Vip3Aa was more potent than Cry1Ac or Cry2Ab against laboratory strains highly resistant to those Cry toxins. Five Cry-susceptible field populations were less susceptible to Vip3Aa than a Cry-susceptible laboratory strain (APHIS-S). Relative to APHIS-S, significant resistance to Vip3Aa did not occur in strains selected in the laboratory for &gt;\u2009700-fold resistance to Cry1Ac or both Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab did not cause strong cross-resistance to Vip3Aa in pink bollworm, which is consistent with predictions based on the lack of shared midgut receptors between these toxins and previous results from other lepidopterans. Comparison of the Bt toxin concentration in plants relative to the median lethal concentration (LC50) from bioassays may be useful for estimating efficacy. The moderate potency of Vip3Aa against Cry1Ac- and Cry2Ab-resistant and susceptible pink bollworm larvae suggests that Bt cotton producing this toxin together with novel Cry toxins might be useful as one component of integrated pest management. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.", "publication_date": "2022-10-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 78, "issue": 10, "first_page": 3973, "last_page": 3979, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Tabashnik%20et%20al%202022%20Pest%20Management%20Science%2078%203973-3979.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/supplementary/Supplemental%20Material%20-%20Tabashnik%20et%20al%202022%20Pest%20Management%20Science%2078%203973-3979.pdf", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662656254, "changed": 1711111834}, {"submission_node_id": 169, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Mortality dynamics of a polyphagous invasive herbivore reveal clues in its agroecosystem success", "doi": "10.1002/ps.7018", "authors": [{"first_name": "Steven E.", "last_name": "Naranjo", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-5600", "affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center, Maricopa, AZ, USA"}, {"first_name": "Luis", "last_name": "Ca\u00f1as", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Entomology, University of Arizona, Maricopa Agricultural Center, Maricopa, AZ, USA"}, {"first_name": "Peter C.", "last_name": "Ellsworth", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2485-0830", "affiliation": "Department of Entomology, University of Arizona, Maricopa Agricultural Center, Maricopa, AZ, USA"}], "funding_agencies": [{"name": "National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)", "award_number": "", "project_number": ""}], "journal": "Pest management science", "issn": "1526-498X", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The population dynamics of polyphagous pests such as Bemisia argentifolii (B. tabaci MEAM1) are governed by complex, interacting factors involving its cultivated and wild host plants, seasonality, movement and demography. To understand mechanisms contributing to population development and pest success within the agroecosystem, contiguous multi-host field sites were established in three environmentally distinct areas in Arizona. Life tables quantified and partition models described mortality sources and rates for immature insect stages on each host plant. RESULTS: Predation and dislodgement were the largest sources of marginal mortality, supplied the highest irreplaceable mortality and predation was the key factor. Rates of mortality were best predicted, in order, by source, temperature, host plant, and season. Marginal mortality was highest for 4th stage nymphs followed by eggs. Mortality rates were predicted in descending order by stage, temperatures and season.  Survivorship patterns varied among host plants, and generational mortality averaged 70% on spring cantaloupes but nearly 95% on all other hosts. Population density varied seasonally, persisting at low levels on winter hosts and expanding beginning in the spring; perennial hosts and weeds bridge populations year-round. CONCLUSION: Survival on winter hosts such as broccoli, albeit low, enables population continuity while unusually high survivorship on spring crops like cantaloupe is an ecological release propelling population growth and driving regional dynamics in the summer and fall.

The deviation of simulated days after sowing was less than 6 days across squaring, flowering, and boll maturity stages. A partial least square model constructed based on satellite NDVI data and days after sowing accurately predicted cotton biomass values (R2 = 0.93, P &amp;lt; 0.05), and the results agreed well with APSIM predicted values (R2 = 0.96, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

In this study, we used 31 environmental factors dataset, field SOC observations (n = 6,213) from the continental US, Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) to (1) select important environmental predictors of SOC stocks, (2) derive functional relationships between environmental factors and SOC stocks, and (3) use the derived functional relationships to predict SOC stocks and compare prediction accuracy of the two approaches. Out of the 31 environmental factors we investigated, 12 were identified as important predictors of SOC stocks by the RF approach. In contrast, the GAM approach identified six (of those 12) environmental factors as important controllers of SOC stocks: potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, soil drainage condition, precipitation, elevation, and net primary productivity. The GAM approach showed minimal SOC predictive importance of the remaining six environmental factors identified by the RF approach. However, the derived functional relationships of these six environmental factors explained 52% of the observed variability of SOC stocks compared to 56% by RF approach using 12 environmental factors.

The specimens were then qualitatively and quantitatively inspected for fluorescence 24 hours later. For the qualitative analysis, three independent observers scored each specimen by direct observation for the presence of a fluorescent mark. The specimens were scored using a portable ultraviolet (UV) tube lantern and a specialized NIGHTSEA-brand LED UV light. The three fluorophores were readily detected on many but not all the species examined, regardless of the type of UV light used. Moreover, the NIGHTSEA LED light yielded fewer false-negative observer errors than the lantern. Each specimen&#039;s fluorescence was measured with an automated dual-wavelength microplate fluorometer for the quantitative analysis. Overall, the quantitative analysis was very reliable at detecting fluorescence on a few taxa (e.g., Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), Chrysoperla spp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), effective on most taxa, and unreliable on several others (e.g., Collops vittatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Melyridae), Geocoris spp. (Hemiptera: Geocoridae), Mecaphesa celer (Hentz) (Araneae: Thomisidae).

To evaluate the new model capabilities in lowland catchments characterized by near-surface groundwater tables and extensive tile drainage, we assess the performance of two SWAT+ model setups in comparison to a setup based on a previous SWAT model version (SWAT\u2083\u209b with a modified three groundwater storage model) in the Kielstau catchment in Northern Germany. The Kielstau catchment has an area of about 50\u2009km\u00b2, is dominated by agricultural land use, and has been thoroughly monitored since 2005. In both SWAT+ setups, the catchment is divided into upland areas and floodplains, but in the first SWAT+ model setup, runoff from the hydrologic response units is summed up at landscape unit level and added directly to the stream. In the second SWAT+ model setup, runoff is routed across the landscape before it reaches the streams. Model results are compared with regard to (i) model performance for stream flow at the outlet of the catchment and (ii) aggregated as well as temporally and spatially distributed water balance components. All three model setups show a very good performance at the catchment outlet. In comparison to a previous version of the SWAT model that produced more groundwater flow, the SWAT+ model produced more tile drainage flow and surface runoff. Results from the new SWAT+ model confirm that the representation of routing processes from uplands to floodplains in the model further improved the representation of hydrological processes. Particularly, the stronger spatial heterogeneity that can be related to characteristics of the landscape, is very promising for a better understanding and model representation of hydrological fluxes in lowland areas.

First adopted in the U.S., the use of the model then spread to Europe and then later to Asia and other regions. The range of applications that SWAT has been applied to have also expanded dramatically, which influenced ongoing model development which has been virtually continuous over the past two decades. A key component of many SWAT applications in Asia is accounting for rice paddy production that is common in some subregions within the continent. However, most of these studies do not provide explicit details of how rice production was simulated in SWAT. Other research has revealed that significant problems occur when trying to represent rice paddy systems in standard versions of SWAT, due to limitations in algorithms based on the runoff curve number approach or the pothole option. In response, key modifications have been made to SWAT in recent studies that have resulted in more accurate representation of rice paddy systems. These developments point to the need for the incorporation of an enhanced rice paddy module within SWAT to better capture rice paddy hydrological and pollutant dynamics, which would support improved use of the model in Asia and other rice production regions. Subtopics related to simulating rice production in SWAT are discussed as follows: (1) an overview of global rice production, (2) history of SWAT development, (3) typical approaches for simulating rice production, (4) problems associated with the typical approaches, (5) recent code modifications to address deficiencies in replicating rice paddy systems, and (6) recommendations for developing a standard rice paddy module for future SWAT codes.", "publication_date": "2022-01-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 15, "issue": 1, "first_page": 1, "last_page": 24, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Gassman%20Int%20J%20Agri%20%26%20Biol%20Eng%202022.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039838, "changed": 1711109073}, {"submission_node_id": 159, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Design and development of a Python-based interface for processing massive data with the LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST)", "doi": "10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104897", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jungang", "last_name": "Gao", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Blackland Research &amp; Extension Center, Texas A&amp;M AgriLife, 702 E.

We propose to conceptually divide the conterminous United States (U.S.) into process domains as a framework for simulating processes and management at relevant scales. Specifically, we are proposing five domains: field (1\u201350 ha), transition (0.2\u20132.0 km\u00b2), headwater (1\u201315 km\u00b2), tributaries (15\u2013150 km\u00b2), and main river (&gt;150 km\u00b2). The proposed conceptual framework hydrologically connects fields across the U.S. using the National Hydrography Dataset (NHDPlus version 2). Parameterizing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool for the national agroecosystem model resulted in 4,880,000 agricultural fields, 2,250,000 non-agricultural hydrologic response units, and 7,130,000 transition, 1,610,000 headwater, 591,000 tributary, and 432,400 main channels. Application of this framework was shown for Hydrologic Unit Code 07120002 in central Illinois and Indiana to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using data that is readily available across the U.S. The new connectivity framework has the potential to dramatically improve national conservation and environmental assessments performed by U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.", "publication_date": "2021-02-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 57, "issue": 1, "first_page": 154, "last_page": 169, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Arnold%20JAWRA%202021.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039838, "changed": 1711108334}, {"submission_node_id": 157, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Integrated assessment of nitrogen runoff to the Gulf of Mexico", "doi": "10.1016/j.reseneeco.2021.101279", "authors": [{"first_name": "Yuelu", "last_name": "Xu", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3867-4655", "affiliation": "Division of Resource Economics and Management, Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, West Virginia University, Agricultural Sciences Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA"}, {"first_name": "Levan", "last_name": "Elbakidze", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Division of Resource Economics and Management, Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, West Virginia University, Agricultural Sciences Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA, Center for Innovation in Gas Research and Utilization, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA"}, {"first_name": "Haw", "last_name": "Yen", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5509-8792", "affiliation": "Crop Science, Bayer U.S., 700 W Chesterfield Pkwy W, Chesterfield, MO 63017, USA, School of Forestry &amp; Wildlife Science, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA"}, {"first_name": "Jeffrey G.", "last_name": "Arnold", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Grassland Soil and Water Research Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Temple, TX 76502, USA"}, {"first_name": "Philip W.", "last_name": "Gassman", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9926-6500", "affiliation": "Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA"}, {"first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Hubbart", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0305-5993", "affiliation": "Institute of Water Security and Science, Schools of Agriculture and Food, and Natural Resources, Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, West Virginia University, 3109 Agricultural Sciences Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA"}, {"first_name": "Michael P.", "last_name": "Strager", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Division of Resource Economics and Management, Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, West Virginia University, Agricultural Sciences Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA"}], "funding_agencies": [{"name": "National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)", "award_number": "WVA00691", "project_number": ""}], "journal": "Resource and Energy Economics", "issn": "0928-7655", "abstract": "An integrated hydro-economic agricultural land use model was developed with endoge-nous and spatially explicit crop planting, nitrogen (N) fertilizer use and irrigation in theMississippi River Basin (MRB).

Characterizing these processes is however difficult and expensive due to their dynamic nature and spatio-temporal variability. Hydropedology is a relatively new discipline focusing on the synergistic integration of hydrology, soil physics and pedology. Hydropedological interpretations of soils and soil distribution can be used to characterize key hydrological processes, especially in areas with no or limited hydrometric measurements. Here we applied a hydropedological approach to reflect flowpaths through detailed routing in SWAT+ for a 157 ha catchment (Weatherley) in South Africa. We compared the hydropedological approach and a standard (no routing) approach against measured streamflow (two weirs) and soil water contents (13 locations). The catchment was treated as \u2018ungauged\u2019 and the model was not calibrated against hydrometric measurements in order to determine the direct contribution of hydropedology on modelling efficiency. Streamflow was predicted well without calibration (NSE &gt; 0.8; R\u00b2 &gt; 0.82) for both approaches at both weirs. The standard approach yielded slightly better streamflow predictions. The hydropedological approach resulted in considerable improvements in the simulation of soil water contents (R\u00b2 increased from 0.40 to 0.49 and PBIAS decreased from 40% to 20%). The routing capacity of SWAT+ as employed in the hydropedological approach reduced the underestimation of wetland water regimes drastically and resulted in a more accurate representation of the dominant hydrological processes in this catchment.

This study chronicled, by the 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial community profile of larvae in a broiler grow-out house synchronizing to when birds were added to and removed from the house over 2.5 years. The profile was found to be relatively constant despite 11 flock rotations and management disruptions, specifically litter cleanout procedures and the addition of new birds or bedding. In contrast, once removed from the controlled broiler house environment and placed into open pastureland, the substantial microbial diversity brought with the larvae showed greater fluctuation in structure with environmental conditions, one of which was rainfall. Surprisingly, these larvae survived at least 19 weeks, so the potential for moving larval-associated microbes into the environment needs further assessment to minimize the risk of relocating foodborne pathogens and also to assess those bacteria-generating metabolites that have benefits to plant growth when using the litter as a fertilizer.

Brassica juncea L. is a native crop of the western and central Asia, is considered a good biodiesel candidate due to its high oil content with high unsaturated fatty acids that can be refined into biofuels that equal petroleum-based fuels characteristics. To build genomic resources for B.juncea, a diversity panel consisting of 340 of accessions, were collected from 22 countries and stored at the USDA repository, and were genotyped to explore genetic diversity, relatedness, and population structure. A total of 99030 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers were identified using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology. Those SNP were distributed over the 18 chromosomes with an average of 5000 SNP per chromosome, an average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.23 and an expected heterozygosity (He) value of 0.281 indicating the genetic diversity within the USDA collection of B. juncea. Population structure and principal components analyses (PCA) based on identified SNPs revealed five distinct subpopulations, with the largest subpopulation containing accessions traced back to Pakistan and India. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 40% of the variation in USDA collection was among the five subpopulations, while 49% of the variation was due to the variation among accessions used in the analysis.

However, studies on avian IO are limited and the development of long-term cultures of IO model for poultry research is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to generate crypt-derived organoids from chicken intestines and to optimize conditions for cell growth and enrichments, passages, and cryopreservation. Crypts were collected from the small intestines of birds at embryonic d-19 and ceca from layer and broiler chickens with ages ranging from d 1 to 20 wk, embedded in a basement membrane matrix, and cultured with organoid growth media (OGM) prepared in house. The crypt-derived organoids were successfully grown and propagated to form 3D spheres like structures that were cultured for up to 3 wk. Organoids were formed on d one, budding appeared on d 3, and robust budding was observed on d 7 and beyond. For cryopreservation, dissociated organoids were resuspended in a freezing medium. The characteristics of IO upon extended passages and freeze-thaw cycles were analyzed using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, immunoblotting, and live cell imaging. Immunoblotting and RTPCR using E-cadherin (the marker for epithelial cells), leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5, the marker for stem cells), chromogranin A (the marker for enteroendocrine cells), lysozyme (the marker for Paneth cells), and mucin (the biomarker for goblet cells) confirmed that IO were composed of heterogeneous cell populations, including epithelial cells, stem cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and goblet cells. Furthermore, OGM supplemented with both valproic acid and CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3b inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased the size of the avian IO (P &amp;lt; 0.001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report for establishing long-term, organoid culture models from small intestines and ceca of layer and broiler chickens.

Day-of-hatch by-product broiler breeder chicks were randomly assigned to a control (0) or supplemented (500 g/MT) diet (n = 23\u221226) and evaluated in a NE challenge model (n = 3). Birds were administered 2X cocci vaccine on d 14 and challenged with a cocktail of Clostridium perfringens strains (107) on d 17 to 19. On d 20 to 21 birds were weighed, euthanized, and scored for NE lesions. Jejunal tissue was collected for kinome analysis using an immunometabolism peptide array (n = 5; 15/treatment) to compare tissue from supplement-fed birds to controls. Mortality and weight were analyzed using Student\u2019s t test and lesion scores analyzed using F test two-sample for variances (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The kinome data was analyzed using PIIKA2 peptide array analysis software and fold-change between control and treated groups determined. Mortality in the supplemented group was 47.4% and 70.7% in controls (P = 0.004). Lesions scores were lower (P = 0.006) in supplemented birds (2.47) compared to controls (3.3). Supplement-fed birds tended (P = 0.19) to be heavier (848.6 g) than controls (796.2 g). Kinome analysis showed T cell receptor, TNF and NF-kB signaling pathways contributed to the improvements seen in the supplement-fed birds. The following peptides were significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in all 3 pathways: CHUK, MAP3K14, MAP3K7, and NFKB1 indicating their importance. Additionally, there were changes to IL6, IL10, and IFN- g mRNA expression in tissue between control- and supplement- fed chickens.

We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depth of 1\u2009m in non-permafrost mineral soils.

Critically, the degree of undersaturation indicates sequestration efficiency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from their mineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average 3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of their capacity.

Methods: We evaluated symbiotic N\u2082 fixation in 17 natural and semi-natural grasslands on four continents that are subjected to the same full-factorial N and P addition experiment, using the \u00b9\u2075N natural abundance method. Results: N as well as combined N and P (NP) addition reduced aboveground legume biomass by 65% and 45%, respectively, compared to the control, whereas P addition had no significant impact. Addition of N and/or P had no significant effect on the symbiotic N\u2082 fixation per unit legume biomass. In consequence, the amount of N fixed annually per grassland area was less than half in the N addition treatments compared to control and P addition, irrespective of whether the dominant legumes were annuals or perennials. Conclusion: Our results reveal that N addition mainly impacts symbiotic N\u2082 fixation via reduced biomass of legumes rather than changes in N\u2082 fixation per unit legume biomass.

However, the influence of nutrients in explaining spatial variation in grassland biomass production has rarely been assessed. Using a global dataset comprising 72 sites on six continents, we investigated which of 16 soil factors that shape nutrient availability associate most strongly with variation in grassland aboveground biomass. Climate and N deposition were also considered. Based on theory-driven structural equation modelling, we found that soil micronutrients (particularly Zn and Fe) were important predictors of biomass and, together with soil physicochemical properties and C:N, they explained more unique variation (32%) than climate and N deposition (24%). However, the association between micronutrients and biomass was absent in grasslands limited by NP. These results highlight soil properties as key predictors of global grassland biomass production and point to serial co-limitation by NP and micronutrients.", "publication_date": "2021-12-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 24, "issue": 12, "first_page": 2713, "last_page": 2725, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/382211%20Fay%20Radujkovic.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039865, "changed": 1710258168}, {"submission_node_id": 141, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Nutrient identity modifies the destabilising effects of eutrophication in grasslands", "doi": "10.1111/ele.13946", "authors": [{"first_name": "Oliver", "last_name": "Carroll", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2514-3422", "affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada"}, {"first_name": "Evan", "last_name": "Batzer", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, California, USA"}, {"first_name": "Siddharth", "last_name": "Bharath", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA"}, {"first_name": "Elizabeth T.", "last_name": "Borer", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2259-5853", "affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA"}, {"first_name": "Sof\u00eda", "last_name": "Campana", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2511-4074", "affiliation": "Facultad de Agronom\u00eda, IFEVA, Universidad de Buenos Aires, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina"}, {"first_name": "Ellen", "last_name": "Esch", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada"}, {"first_name": "Yann", "last_name": "Hautier", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Ecology and Biodiversity Group, Department of Biology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands"}, {"first_name": "Timothy", "last_name": "Ohlert", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA"}, {"first_name": "Eric W.", "last_name": "Seabloom", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6780-9259", "affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA"}, {"first_name": "Peter B.", "last_name": "Adler", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4216-4009", "affiliation": "Department of Wildland Resources and the Ecology Center, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA"}, {"first_name": "Jonathan D.", "last_name": "Bakker", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"}, {"first_name": "Lori", "last_name": "Biederman", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA"}, {"first_name": "Miguel N.", "last_name": "Bugalho", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Centre for Applied Ecology &quot;Prof. Baeta Neves&quot; (CEABN-InBIO), School of Agriculture, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"}, {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Caldeira", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Forest Research Centre, School of Agriculture, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"}, {"first_name": "Qingqing", "last_name": "Chen", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1957-3848", "affiliation": "Institute of Ecology, College of Urban and Environmental Science, and Key Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes of the Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"first_name": "Kendi F.", "last_name": "Davies", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA"}, {"first_name": "Philip A.", "last_name": "Fay", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "USDA-ARS Grassland Soil and Water Research Lab, Temple, Texas, USA"}, {"first_name": "Johannes M.

Host responses to infectious agents are often regulated through phosphorylation. However, proteomic mechanisms of Salmonella acute infection biology and host responses to the bacteria have been limited concentrating predominately on the genomic responses of the host to infection. Our recent development of chicken-specific peptide arrays for kinome analysis of host phosphorylation-based cellular signaling responses provided us with the opportunity to develop a more detailed understanding of the early (4-24 h post-infection) host-pathogen interactions during the initial colonization of the cecum by Salmonella. Using the chicken-specific kinomic immune peptide array, biological pathway analysis showed infection with S. Enteritidis increased signaling related to the innate immune response, relative to the non-infected control ceca. Notably, the acute innate immune signaling pathways were characterized by increased peptide phosphorylation (activation) of the Toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways, the activation of the chemokine signaling pathway, and the activation of the apoptosis signaling pathways. In addition, Salmonella infection induced a dramatic alteration in the phosphorylation events of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Lastly, there is also significant activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway demonstrating the initiation of the acquired immune response to Salmonella infection. Based on the individual phosphorylation events altered by the early Salmonella infection of the cecum, certain conclusions can be drawn: (1) Salmonella was recognized by both TLR and NOD receptors that initiated the innate immune response; (2) activation of the PPRs induced the production of chemokines CXCLi2 (IL-8) and cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3; (3) Salmonella infection targeted the JAK-STAT pathway as a means of evading the host response by targeting the dephosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 and STAT1,2,3,4, and 6; (4) apoptosis appears to be a host defense mechanism where the infection with Salmonella induced both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways; and (5) the T cell receptor signaling pathway activates the AP-1 and NF-\u03baB transcription factor cascades, but not NFAT.", "publication_date": "2022-06-30", "date_other": "", "volume": 12, "issue": "", "first_page": "", "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Chicken-specific%20kinome%20analysis.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039834, "changed": 1710124508}, {"submission_node_id": 139, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Soil extracellular oxidases mediated nitrogen fertilization effects on soil organic carbon sequestration in bioenergy croplands", "doi": "10.1111/gcbb.12860", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jianjun", "last_name": "Duan", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Tobacco Quality, College of Tobacco Science, Guizhou University, Guiyang, China"}, {"first_name": "Min", "last_name": "Yuan", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA, Kiwifruit Breeding and Utilization Key Laboratory, Sichuan Provincial Academy of Natural Resource Sciences, Chengdu, China"}, {"first_name": "Siyang", "last_name": "Jian", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Microbiology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA"}, {"first_name": "Lahiru", "last_name": "Gamage", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA"}, {"first_name": "Madhav", "last_name": "Parajuli", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA"}, {"first_name": "Kudjo E.", "last_name": "Dzantor", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA"}, {"first_name": "Dafeng", "last_name": "Hui", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5284-2897", "affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA"}, {"first_name": "Philip A.", "last_name": "Fay", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "Grassland Soil and Water Research Laboratory, USDA ARS, Temple, TX, USA"}, {"first_name": "Jianwei", "last_name": "Li", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0429-3627", "affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN, USA"}], "funding_agencies": [{"name": "Agricultural Research Service (ARS)", "award_number": "1017802", "project_number": "58-3098-9-005"}], "journal": "GCB Bioenergy", "issn": "1757-1693", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) fertilization significantly affects soil extracellular oxidases, agents responsible for decomposition of slow turnover and recalcitrant soil organic carbon (SOC; e.g., lignin), and consequently influences soil carbon sequestration capacity. However, it remains unclear how soil oxidases mediate SOC sequestration under N fertilization, and whether these effects co-vary with plant type (e.g., bioenergy crop species). Using a spatially explicit design and intensive soil sampling strategy under three fertilization treatments in switchgrass (SG: Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (GG: Tripsacum dactyloides L.) croplands, we quantified the activities of polyphenolic oxidase (PHO), peroxidase (PER), and their sum associated with recalcitrant C acquisition (OX).

Besides correlations between soil oxidases and SOC (formerly published), both descriptive and geostatistical approaches were applied to evaluate the effects of N fertilization and crop type on soil oxidases activities and their spatial distributions. Results showed significantly negative correlations between soil oxidase activities and SOC across all treatments. The negative relationship of soil oxidases and SOC was also evident under N fertilization. First, LN significantly depressed oxidases in both mean activities and spatial heterogeneity, which corresponded to increased SOC in SG (though by 5.4%). LN slightly influenced oxidases activities and their spatial heterogeneity, consistent with insignificant changes of SOC in GG. Second, HN showed trends of decrease in soil oxidase activities, which aligned with the significantly enhanced SOC in both croplands.

Here, we leverage a globally distributed nutrient addition experiment (the Nutrient Network) to examine how a decade of N and P fertilization (alone and in combination) influenced soil C and N stocks at nine grassland sites spanning the continental United States. We measured changes in bulk soil C and N stocks and in three soil C fractions (light and heavy particulate organic matter, and mineral-associated organic matter fractions). Nutrient amendment had variable effects on soil C and N pools that ranged from strongly positive to strongly negative, while soil C and N pool sizes varied by more than an order of magnitude across sites. Piecewise SEM clarified that small increases in plant C inputs with fertilization did not translate to greater soil C storage. Nevertheless, peak season aboveground plant biomass (but not root biomass or production) was strongly positively related to soil C storage at seven of the nine sites, and across all nine sites, soil C covaried with moisture index and soil mineralogy, regardless of fertilization. Overall, we show that site factors such as moisture index, plant productivity, soil texture, and mineralogy were key predictors of cross-site soil C, while nutrient amendment had weaker and site-specific effects on C sequestration.

While this intensified pattern did not alter total precipitation amount, it generally led to ecosystem responses consistent with a drier environment (for example, reduced soil moisture, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and soil CO\u2082 flux, but little evidence for altered root biomass). Surprisingly, this history of intensified precipitation patterns did not affect the response of ANPP to the subsequent extreme drought. In contrast, previous exposure to intensified precipitation patterns reduced root production and muted soil CO\u2082 flux responses to rainfall events during drought.

To understand mechanisms contributing to population development and pest success within the agroecosystem, contiguous multi-host field sites were established in three environmentally distinct areas in Arizona. Life tables quantified and partition models described mortality sources and rates for immature insect stages on each host plant. RESULTS: Predation and dislodgement were the largest sources of marginal mortality, supplied the highest irreplaceable mortality and predation was the key factor. Rates of mortality were best predicted, in order, by source, temperature, host plant, and season. Marginal mortality was highest for 4th stage nymphs followed by eggs. Mortality rates were predicted in descending order by stage, temperatures and season.  Survivorship patterns varied among host plants, and generational mortality averaged 70% on spring cantaloupes but nearly 95% on all other hosts. Population density varied seasonally, persisting at low levels on winter hosts and expanding beginning in the spring; perennial hosts and weeds bridge populations year-round. CONCLUSION: Survival on winter hosts such as broccoli, albeit low, enables population continuity while unusually high survivorship on spring crops like cantaloupe is an ecological release propelling population growth and driving regional dynamics in the summer and fall. This detailed understanding of mortality dynamics provides clues to the success of this invasive pest in our agroecosystems and facilitates opportunities for improved pest management at a broader landscape scale.", "publication_date": "2022-05-29", "date_other": "", "volume": 78, "issue": 10, "first_page": 3988, "last_page": 4005, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Naranjo%20et%20al%20PMS2022.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039832, "changed": 1710124247}, {"submission_node_id": 135, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "Design of tailwater recovery systems accounting for irrigation system operation and performance", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0001703", "authors": [{"first_name": "Eduardo", "last_name": "Bautista", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9498-1126", "affiliation": "Research Hydraulic Engineer, USDA-ARS US Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, 21881 North Cardon Lane, Maricopa, AZ 85138"}, {"first_name": "James L.

The analysis expands on procedures developed by previous authors and aims to account for the operation and performance of the irrigation system on tailwater system design.   The method is demonstrated with a hypothetical test case which was examined under a range of inflow rates per furrow and target application depths. While the required tailwater sump capacity largely depends on the area to be irrigated and the maximum target irrigation depth, capacity requirements will increase if large imbalances between inflows and outflows occur by design.  Imbalances can be reduced by a judicious selection of the unit inflow rate and tolerated runoff fractions, but when the supply inflow rate is fixed, adjustments to the unit inflow rate may not be feasible or limited.  Since pump-back depends on the runoff fraction, it is desirable to limit runoff losses subject to their impact on irrigation system performance. Because of uncertainty and variability of infiltration and runoff, a tailwater system will inevitably be subject to imbalances.  If runoff from the initial irrigation set can be measured and the tailwater pump-back rate can be adjusted, the configuration of the tailwater system can be modified before pump-back begins to mitigate imbalances caused by infiltration variability.", "publication_date": "2022-06-29", "date_other": "", "volume": 148, "issue": 9, "first_page": "04022029", "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/%28ASCE%29IR.1943-4774.0001703.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1662039827, "changed": 1710103794}, {"submission_node_id": 134, "submitter_email": "", "submitter_name": "Anonymous", "title": "High frequency of ryanodine receptor and cytochrome P450 CYP9A186 mutations in insecticide-resistant field populations of Spodoptera exigua from China", "doi": "10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105153", "authors": [{"first_name": "Haiyuan", "last_name": "Teng", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China, Institute of Eco-Environmental and Plant Protection, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai 201403, China"}, {"first_name": "Yayun", "last_name": "Zuo", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China, Institute of Pesticide Science, College of Plant Protection, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China"}, {"first_name": "Jing", "last_name": "Yaun", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China"}, {"first_name": "Jeffrey A.", "last_name": "Fabrick", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "USDA ARS, U.S. Arid Land Agricultural Research Center, Maricopa, AZ 85138, USA"}, {"first_name": "Yidong", "last_name": "Wu", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China"}, {"first_name": "Yihua", "last_name": "Yang", "name_suffix": "", "orcid": "", "affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China"}], "funding_agencies": [{"name": "Agricultural Research Service (ARS)", "award_number": "", "project_number": ""}], "journal": "Pesticide biochemistry and physiology", "issn": "0048-3575", "abstract": "The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua is a global agricultural pest that is polyphagous, highly dispersive, and often difficult to control due to resistance to many insecticides. Previous studies showed that a target site mutation in the S. exigua ryanodine receptor (SeRyR) corresponding to I4743M contributes approximately 20-fold resistance to chlorantraniliprole, whereas a mutation in the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP9A186 corresponding to F116V confers 200-fold to emamectin benzoate through enhanced metabolic detoxification. Here, high frequencies of mutations were found among six China S. exigua field populations collected from 2016 to 2019 resulting in SeRyR I4743M and CYP9A186 F116V substitutions, with some populations having high levels of resistance to chlorantraniliprole and emamectin benzoate, respectively. Whereas we found a significant correlation between emamectin benzoate resistance level and the allele frequency of CYP9A186 F116V, no significant correlation was found between chlorantraniliprole resistance level and SeRyR I4743M allele frequency in the six field populations. These results suggest that CYP9A186 F116V is a major resistance mechanism for emamectin benzoate in the tested field populations, whereas it is likely that resistance mechanisms other than SeRyR I4743M are responsible for resistance to chlorantraniliprole in the six China field populations.

Although meta-analyses on non-target effects of GM crops producing insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been published, many field studies from Europe and other parts of the world have been published in the last decade, and those data are often not covered by previous meta-analyses. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to answer the question: \u201cDoes the growing of Bt maize change abundance or ecological function of non-target animals compared to the growing of non-GM maize?\u201d Methods: Literature was searched systematically in multiple bibliographic databases, specialized homepages, and reference sections of review articles. Defined inclusion criteria were applied to screen titles, abstracts, and full texts of the retrieved references. A custom-made database was developed with quantitative data on invertebrate abundance, activity density, or predation/parasitism rates. Data not fitting the database were captured in tables for the narrative summary. Critical appraisal was applied to each record in the database to estimate the risk of bias and the suitability to answer the review question. Meta-analyses on different taxonomic levels and functional groups were conducted. Untreated Bt maize was either compared to untreated non-Bt maize, or to insecticide-treated non-Bt maize. The influence of private involvement and peer review on reported effects was investigated. Review findings: The database on non-target effects of Bt maize field trials contains more than 7200 records from 120 publications. Meta-analyses on different taxonomic levels revealed only few effect sizes significantly different to zero when both Bt maize and non-Bt maize were not treated with insecticides. Bt maize harboured fewer parasitoids (Braconidae, Tachinidae) of the European corn borer, the main target pest of Lepidoptera-active Bt maize compared to non-Bt maize. Similarly, sap beetles (Nitidulidae), that are associated with Lepidoptera damage, were recorded less in Bt maize. In some analyses, a weak adverse effect of Bt maize was observed for rove beetles (Staphylinidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) and a positive effect for ladybeetles (Coccinellidae). However, those effects were not consistent for the different analyses we conducted and vanished with the removal of individual significant studies. More effects on different taxonomic groups, in particular predators, were evident when untreated Bt maize was compared to pyrethroid-treated non-Bt maize. The results of the narrative summary confirmed the outcome of meta-analyses. There was no evidence for publication bias.

Here, we investigated the genetic basis of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in the lepidopteran Helicoverpa zea, one of the most damaging crop pests in the United States. To facilitate this research, we built the first chromosome-level genome assembly for this species, which has 31 chromosomes containing 375\u2009Mb and 15,482 predicted proteins. Using a genome-wide association study, fine-scale mapping, and RNA-seq, we identified a 250-kb quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 13 that was strongly associated with resistance in a strain of H. zea that had been selected for resistance in the field and lab. The mutation in this QTL contributed to but was not sufficient for resistance, which implies alleles in more than one gene contributed to resistance. This QTL contains no genes with a previously reported role in resistance or susceptibility to Bt toxins. However, in resistant insects, this QTL has a premature stop codon in a kinesin gene which is a primary candidate as a mutation contributing to resistance. We found no changes in gene sequence or expression consistently associated with resistance for 11 genes previously implicated in lepidopteran resistance to Cry1Ac.

Limiting the extent and sizes of low-cover patches thus should be a target of adaptive management on grazed grasslands, but quantifying patch sizes requires pasture (paddock)-level measurements at small spatial resolution (grain).  We used airborne (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) remote sensing to measure green plant cover at a spatial grain of 8 cm ground sample distance.  From these measurements, we quantified the aerial extent and patch sizes of mesic grassland in central Texas, USA in which green plant cover was eliminated during drought in each of two grazing treatments (rotational, continuous).  Remote measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicative of plant biomass, then were used to compare post-drought recovery of vegetation in patches that lacked vs. retained green plant cover during drought (not green vs. green).  Seasonal drought eliminated green plant cover from 5-12% of grassland area.  Across grazing treatments, 43% of the not-green area during drought occurred in large (&amp;gt;30 m2) patches.  NDVI recovered quickly from drought, however.  Within two years, seasonal mean values of NDVI were similar or greater in previously not-green than green patches.  Vegetation in previously not-green patches recovered rapidly because of a marked increase in relative abundances of early-season annual species.  Recovery in NDVI was reduced in large compared to small (&amp;lt;1 m2) patches that lacked green cover during drought and in the continuous vs. rotational grazing treatment.

Microbial soil inocula were added to a consistent background soil to avoid physicochemical variation across the sources. We found that the soil microbial inoculum source mattered more than cultivar in determining switchgrass biomass. The addition of microbes resulted in smaller plants, with largest plants found on control soils with no inoculum, but some inocula were less negative than others. There was no geographic matching between cultivars and soil microbial inoculum, suggesting little local adaptation to the biotic component of soils.

One of the obstacles to the management of B. tabaci is the quantification of damage by the pest because damage is indirectly inferred through losses in productivity. The objective of this study was to characterize the influence of B. tabaci feeding on soybean by assessing effects on photosynthetic parameters and the sugar and starch content of soybean leaves. The goal was to identify the optimal parameter to directly quantify pest damage on crop yield. Correlation networks were created among data on sugar content (fructose, glucose, and sucrose), starch and photosynthetic parameters (initial fluorescence, performance index on absorption basis, and turn-over number), and the number of nymphs at each of three infestations level (low, medium, and high) during both the vegetative and reproductive stage of the crop. In general, nymphs were more abundant during the vegetative stage. Starch content was strongly correlated with nymph density. A strong positive correlation was observed between fructose and nymph density during the vegetative stage.

Frass, which is the manure of insects, can be used to enhance fish and plant production, but no study has yet examined the potential to enhance both using a dietary approach in an aquaponic system. In this 8-week study, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) juveniles were fed diets with, or without, 10% black solider fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) frass in an aquaponic system. Each aquaponic system had two different plant bed types; floating raft or media. Each plant bed consisted of three stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) and three lavender (Lavaridula angustifolia) plants in a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial design, with the main effects of dietary frass inclusion and media type. After 8\u00a0weeks, channel catfish grew significantly faster when fed a diet containing 10% BSFL frass compared to fish fed the control diet. Further, dietary frass upregulated the hepatic expression of IGF\u03b2, IGF-1 and GHR as well as reduced intestinal inflammation based on histological observations and scoring. The muscle proximate composition of channel catfish was unaffected by diet, while only taurine was significantly reduced by dietary frass. Muscle calcium and phosphorus as well as C14:0 and C15:0 were significantly elevated by dietary frass. For plants, both stevia and lavender had significantly more biomass when frass was added to the system, while plants grown in media beds were larger than plants grown in a floating raft subsystem. Frass significantly increased phosphorus in both stevia and lavender at week 8. The higher water calcium, magnesium, and nitrate levels may have allowed for better plant growth as these are essential nutrients.

The few studies that still place Eriophyoidea within Trombidiformes are likely to be biased by incomplete taxon/gene sampling, long branch attraction, the omission of RNA secondary structure in sequence alignment, and the inclusion of hypervariable expansion\u2013contraction rRNA regions. Based on the agreement among a number of independent analyses that use a range of different datasets (morphology; multiple genes; mitochondrial/whole genomes), Eriophyoidea are almost certain to be closely related to Nematalycidae, a family of vermiform mites within Endeostigmata, a basal acariform grade. Much of the morphological evidence in support of this relationship was apparent after the discovery of Nematalycidae in the middle of the 20th century. However, this evidence has largely been disregarded until very recently, perhaps because of overconfidence in the placement of Eriophyoidea within Trombidiformes.

Large differences exist between the genomes of Atlantic salmon of European origin and North American (N.A.) origin. Given the genetic and genomic differences between the 2 lineages, it is crucial to develop unique genomic resources for N.A. Atlantic salmon. Here, we describe the resources that we recently developed for genomic and genetic research in N.A. Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Firstly, a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database for N.A. Atlantic salmon consisting of 3.1 million putative SNPs was generated using data from whole-genome resequencing of 80 N.A. Atlantic salmon individuals. Secondly, a high-density 50K SNP array enriched for the genic regions of the genome and containing 3 sex determination and 61 putative continent of origin markers was developed and validated. Thirdly, a genetic map composed of 27 linkage groups with 36K SNP markers was generated from 2,512 individuals in 141 full-sib families. Finally, a chromosome-level de novo genome assembly from a male N.A. Atlantic salmon from the St. John River aquaculture strain was generated using PacBio long reads. Information from Hi-C proximity ligation sequences and Bionano optical mapping was used to concatenate the contigs into scaffolds. The assembly contains 1,755 scaffolds and only 1,253 gaps, with a total length of 2.83\u2005Gb and N50 of 17.2\u2005Mb. A BUSCO analysis detected 96.2% of the conserved Actinopterygii genes in the assembly, and the genetic linkage information was used to guide the formation of 27 chromosome sequences. Comparative analysis with the reference genome assembly of the European Atlantic salmon confirmed that the karyotype differences between the 2 lineages are caused by a fission in chromosome Ssa01 and 3 chromosome fusions including the p arm of chromosome Ssa01 with Ssa23, Ssa08 with Ssa29, and Ssa26 with Ssa28. The genomic resources we have generated for Atlantic salmon provide a crucial boost for genetic research and for management of farmed and wild populations in this highly valued species.

Floral trait responses and related effects on plant reproductive success were recorded. Plants grown under temperature and water stresses were shorter and had fewer leaves at flowering than control plants. Temperature\u2010stressed plants flowered earlier and had smaller flowers that produced fewer per capita pollen grains than control and water\u2010stressed plants. While lifetime flower production in plants experiencing temperature stress alone or water stress alone was similar to control plants, those receiving combined temperature and water stresses had significantly lower lifetime flower production. Abiotic stress did not affect investment in female traits such as ovule number per flower, but impacted male traits seen as fewer pollen grains per flower. In plants experiencing abiotic stress, an increase in autonomous self\u2010pollination was facilitated through a compromise in herkogamy, a sexual interference mechanism that promotes cross\u2010pollination. Spatial separation between stigma and anther, a measure of herkogamy was zero or negative in stressed plants. Thus, abiotic stress responses in plants did not compromise plant reproductive success as autonomous selfing was augmented. In nature, such responses will likely reduce available nutrition for pollinators through decreased flower and pollen production.

As a result, fish farmers are interested in applying kaolin products but were hesitant as they feared that the high doses of kaolin clay in vats might negatively affect the gills and overall health of fish. Therefore, we evaluated potential clay concentrations that might be used to prophylactically treat fish in vats. The effects of low to excessively high doses (0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 g/L) of kaolin clay (AkuaPro\u1d40\u1d39, Imerys, GA, USA) were evaluated using a 72 h bioassay conducted in static tanks using Micropterus salmoides, Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Lepomis macrochirus, Ictalurus punctatus, Notemigonus crysoleucas, and Pimephales promelas. Results of these trials revealed a 100% survival rate across all six fish species exposed to kaolin clay at concentrations of up to 8 g/L for 48 h (followed by a 24 h recovery period in clean water) with no adverse effects to eyes, skin, gastrointestinal tract, or liver histology noted at any treatment.

Since the prices of fertilizers have increased and the activity of soil microbes may greatly affect fertilizer utilization, it is important to investigate the effect of fertilization on microbes. Samples were collected from pecan trees receiving full nitrogen (70lbs/acre), half nitrogen (35 lbs/acre), and no nitrogen (0 lbs/acre) fertilization in an orchard. Microbes were characterized by using the next generation sequencing and annotated into functional groups (trophic mode and nitrogen related) by FUNGuild and FAPROTAX. Our results showed the core fungal genera in this orchard were Tuber and Hymenoscyphus, while the core bacterial families were Chitinophagaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, and Chthoniobacteraceae. Among them, the pecan truffle Tuber lyonii was the dominant fungus. In association with an increase of nitrogen fertilization, the Simpson Index (SI) of fungi in roots was decreased, and the presence of pathotroph was increased, implying that the risk of plant infection by pathogens was increased. The pecan with half rate of nitrogen fertilizer had the highest colonization of symbiotrophic fungi, the lowest presence of pathotrophic fungi, and the highest relative abundance of Tuber. The relative abundances of bacteria related to nitrate reduction, nitrogen respiration, and nitrate respiration were found to be the highest in pecan with half rate of nitrogen fertilizer, which might imply the highest efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization in this treatment. It revealed that applying half the recommended nitrogen rate of fertilizer could improve beneficial microbe presence, perhaps increasing nitrogen uptake and decreasing nitrogen needed for optimum production.", "publication_date": "2023-11-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 321, "issue": "", "first_page": 112365, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20405747%20-%20Changes%20in%20the%20diversity%20of%20pecan%20.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 443446, "log_number": 405747, "created": 1691585641, "changed": 1710018394}, {"submission_node_id": 618, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Results from our study demonstrate that T. ni larvae exposed to fungal entomopathogens had higher total phenoloxidase activity compared to controls, indicating that the melanization cascade is one of the main immune components driving defense against fungal infection and contrasting observations from other insect\u2013fungi interaction studies. We also observed differences in host response depending on the species of entomopathogenic fungi, with significantly higher induction observed during infections with B. bassiana than with C. javanica. Larvae exposed to B. bassiana had an increased expression of genes involved in prophenoloxidase response and the Imd, JNK, and Jak/STAT immune signaling pathways. Our results indicate a notable absence of Toll pathway-related responses, further contrasting results to other insect\u2013fungi pathosystems. Important differences were also observed in the induction of antimicrobial effectors, with B. bassiana infections eliciting three antimicrobial effectors (lysozyme, gloverin, and cecropin), while C. javanica only induced cecropin expression. These results provide insight into the host response strategies employed by T. ni for protection against entomopathogenic fungi and increase our understanding of insect\u2013fungal entomopathogen interactions, aiding in the design of more effective microbial control strategies for this important agricultural pest.

However, questions remain regarding acculturation proxy measures and their associations with diet quality in Hispanic Americans. Objective: Primary objectives included estimating percentages of Hispanic Americans with low, moderate, and high acculturation using two proxy measures based on different language variables; and identifying similarities and dissimilarities in diet quality differences by acculturation level between Mexican Americans and other Hispanic Americans. Methods: Study sample included 1,733 Mexican American and 1,191 other Hispanic participants \u226516 years of age from NHANES 2015-2018. Proxy measures included in the two acculturation scales were: nativity/length of United States (US) residence, immigration age, language spoken at home (home), and language of dietary recall (recall). Replicate 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted and diet quality was assessed using 2015 Healthy Eating Index. Statistical methods for complex survey designs were used for analysis. Results: For Mexican Americans, 8%, 35%, and 58% had low, moderate, and high acculturation on the home scale vs 8%, 30%, and 62% on the recall scale. For other Hispanics, 17%, 39%, and 43% had low, moderate, and high acculturation on the home scale vs 18%, 34%, and 48% on the recall scale. Similarities between ethnicities included higher acculturation associated with lower intakes of fruits, vegetables, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, and saturated fats and greater intake of sodium. Dissimilarities included higher acculturation associated with more whole grains and added sugars intakes and less refined grains intake (Mexican Americans), and less total dairy and fatty acids intakes (other Hispanic Americans). Conclusions: Similarities and dissimilarities between Mexican Americans\u2019 and other Hispanic Americans\u2019 diet quality differences by acculturation level exist regardless of language variable used to measure acculturation.

When pooling across water source and date, TifTuf maintained the highest visual quality and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) compared with both Midiron and Tifway. This was accompanied by a greater daily ET\u2090 rate, clipping production, and water use efficiency (WUE) compared with Midiron in both studies. When pooling across variety and date, daily ET\u2090 of turfgrass receiving recycled water was 5% to 10% less than those receiving the local well or RO water. In addition, turfgrasses receiving local well water held the greatest visual quality and NDVI compared with those receiving either RO water in the summer study. Visual quality and NDVI were also less in turfgrasses receiving RO water compared with those receiving local well or recycled water in the fall. Despite turfgrasses having a lower ET\u2090 under recycled water in both study periods, these plants had significantly greater clipping production compared with RO water in the summer. Also, clipping production under recycled water did not differ significantly from the other two sources in the fall study. Furthermoe, in both studies, WUE was similar for turfgrasses receiving recycled water compared with those receiving RO or local well water. Results demonstrated that irrigation water quality influences critical factors for hybrid bermudagrass growth and that considerable variability exists among three commercially available varieties for evapotranspiration rates, quality, and clipping production.

Automated spectral acquisition can be performed using a direct-drive XY moving stage for solid, powder, and liquid samples placed in customized well plates or randomly scattered in standard Petri dishes (e.g., bacterial colonies). Three LED lights (white backlight, UV ring light, and white ring light) and two miniature color cameras are used for machine vision measurements of samples in the Petri dishes using different combinations of illuminations and imaging modalities (e.g., transmission, fluorescence, and color). Real-time image processing and motion control techniques are used to implement automated sample counting, positioning, sampling, and synchronization functions. System software was developed using LabVIEW with integrated artificial intelligence functions able to identify and label interesting targets instantly. The system capability was demonstrated by an example application for rapid identification of five common foodborne bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp.. Using a machine learning model based on a linear support vector machine, a classification accuracy of 98.6% was achieved using Raman spectra automatically collected from 222 bacterial colonies of the five species grown on nutrient nonselective agar in 90 mm Petri dishes.

Such lacking information includes understanding whether natural AMF populations are sufficient to ensure healthy colonization in new plantings, and what factors influence AMF in established plantings. AMF colonization of grapevine fine roots was determined in 32 commercial vineyards and in a vineyard that was heavily infested by the northern root-knot nematode (NRKN, Meloidogyne hapla). Root colonization by AMF was as extensive in young vines (one- to two-years-old) as in older vines (&gt;15-years-old) examined in the survey and was high throughout the season in the single vineyard trial. AMF colonization was greater overall in red wine grape cultivars than in white wine grape cultivars. AMF colonization correlated negatively with soil nitrate and leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations across vineyards, while arbuscules in roots correlated negatively with NRKN populations in soil. Both AMF and arbuscules in roots correlated negatively with NRKN populations per unit of fine root length at the beginning and end of the growing season in the heavily infested vineyard. Results suggest that AMF populations in soils of the Columbia River basin are ample to ensure high levels of grapevine root colonization, so inoculation is likely not needed when planting or replanting vineyards in the region.

This study evaluated the photocatalytic properties of three types of porphyrin molecules to break down tylosin in deionized water. It was observed that when irradiated with 3.06 eV light the concentration of tylosin decreases by 13.88% after 180 min in the presence of octoethylporphyrin. Similarly, after 180-minute exposure the concentration of tylosin decreases by 17.92% in the presence of tetraphenylporphyrin. Lastly, in the presence of copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin the concentration of tylosin was observed to decrease by 21.20% after 180-minute exposure to near UV light. Furthermore, it was observed that in the presence of CuTPP the concentration of tylosin decreased by up to 12.54% in a pond water sample over a 24 h period.

This study investigated the effect of EC on the soil respiration and the microbial component during two successive growing seasons in a deficit irrigation peanut production system on the US Southern Great Plains. We evaluated the soil microbial community size and composition using ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) profiling and changes in soil metabolic activity by measuring soil respiration and \u00df-glucosidase activity. The 2 year-study mean showed that EC shifted the soil microbial community composition by 46% towards greater arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) markers compared to ambient [CO\u2082] (AC) conditions. Soil respiration was increased by 82% in EC conditions during the soil water-deficit periods, however, there were no significant changes in \u00df-glucosidase activity, the enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step of cellulose degradation. Our results show that EC increased the soil organic carbon, indicating that the soil nutrient availability at limited soil moisture.

Within these island communities, multiple Cyrtandra species are commonly observed to occur sympatrically in wet forest understories, forming swarms of what appear to be ecologically similar taxa. The aim of this study was to determine if communities of these plants are randomly assembled with respect to phylogenetic relatedness and traits that are ecologically relevant. Using a combination of ten functional traits and a well-resolved species phylogeny, I examined community assembly within 34 species of Cyrtandra across three Pacific archipelagoes. Coexisting species were generally found to be more closely related and more phenotypically similar than would be expected by chance. This pattern was observed at both broad (island communities) and fine (site communities) spatial scales. The retention of phylogenetic signal in floral traits and the strong influence of these traits on the observed degree of phylogenetic clustering may indicate that pollinators act as a biotic filter for closely related species of Cyrtandra. In contrast, the absence of phylogenetic signal in most leaf traits, coupled with the lower contribution of these traits to niche clustering, suggests that environmental filtering along this trait axis is minimal in the observed communities.

This work evaluated two genetically engineered constructs containing a suite of heterologous genes to increase carotenoid stability and pathway flux, as well as phytase to catabolize phytate and increase mineral bioaccessibility. Model porridges made from transgenic events were evaluated for carotenoid and mineral content as well as bioaccessibility.

Phytase activation by pre-steeping flour resulted in significant phytate reduction (9.4 to 4.2 mg g\u2212\u00b9 DW), altered the profile of inositol phosphate catabolites, and reduced molar ratios of phytate to iron (16.0 to 4.1), and zinc (19.0 to 4.9) in engineered material, suggesting improved mineral bioaccessibility.

To date, data on Miscanthus production in the US has been based on small scale research plots due to the lack of commercial scale production fields. Research plot yields are often much higher than commercial fields for a variety of reasons including reduced spatial variability and location on better quality farmland. The objectives of this study were to quantify the inputs for production of Miscanthus at the commercial farm scale, evaluating methods to characterize fuel use for establishment and management of Miscanthus production and using satellite data to characterize spatial yield variation of production fields. We logged energy use on agricultural machinery from Miscanthus production planted on more than 1000 ha of land and modeled N\u2082O emissions and changes in soil carbon using DayCent. Although fuel use was higher for land preparation in fields with perennial vegetation, fuel to harvest Miscanthus dominated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (&amp;gt;90%) from agriculture machinery for crop management. The N\u2082O emissions and changes in soil carbon were the largest source and sink of GHG emissions associated with Miscanthus production, respectively. Although ~ 50% of the established lands had Miscanthus yields &amp;lt; 5 Mg/ha, yields needed to be &amp;gt; 5 Mg/ha for \u0394SOC to be positive. Given the large impact of yield on \u0394SOC, net GHG for Miscanthus production with yields of 5 to 25 Mg/ha ranged ~130 to -260 kg CO\u2082e/Mg biomass. Use of both energy use for Miscanthus harvest and satellite imagery were good methods to characterize spatial variability of commercial production fields. This demonstrates the potential to use this within field yield data to better understand factors driving subfield yield variability and use of satellite data to quantify early yield predictions.

It is generally accepted that nymphs emerging from overwintered eggs feed on surrounding vegetation and subsequent adults move to and reproduce on weed hosts such as horsemint for one or two generations in the spring before infesting cotton fields. Although horsemint is widely distributed throughout Central Texas, its abundance in some cotton production areas, including the Brazos River Bottom (BRB), is considered insufficient to support the magnitude of CFH infestations commonly observed in surrounding cotton fields. We examined the temporal patterns of nymphs emerging from overwintered eggs in woolly croton in 2018 and 2019 to determine whether subsequent adults could directly infest cotton fields in the BRB production area. Based on the timing of peak nymph emergence, estimated development time of nymphs, and phenology of cotton between late April and May, our findings, particularly in 2018, illustrate that adult CFHs arising from overwintered eggs in woolly croton could feasibly infest cotton directly without the need for an intermediate host.

To explore the role of butyrate on bovine rumen epithelial function and development, this study characterized genome-wide H3K27ac modification changes and super-enhancer profiles in rumen epithelial primary cells (REPC) induced with butyrate by ChIP-seq, and analyzed its effects on gene expression and functional pathways by integrating RNA-seq data. The results showed that genome-wide acetylation modification was observed in the REPC with 94,675 and 48,688 peaks in the butyrate treatment and control group, respectively. A total of 9750 and 5020 genes with increased modification (H3K27ac-gain) and decreased modification (H3K27ac-loss) were detected in the treatment group. The super-enhancer associated genes in the butyrate-induction group were involved in the AMPK signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction. Finally, the up-regulated genes (PLCG1, CLEC3B, IGSF23, OTOP3, ADTRP) with H3K27ac gain modification by butyrate were involved in cholesterol metabolism, lysosome, cell adhesion molecules, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Butyrate treatment has the role of genome-wide H3K27ac acetylation on bovine REPC, and affects the changes in gene expression. The effect of butyrate on gene expression correlates with the acetylation of the H3K27ac level. Identifying genome-wide acetylation modifications and expressed genes of butyrate in bovine REPC cells will expand the understanding of the biological role of butyrate and its acetylation.

In this study, we performed genome-wide identifications and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes in six Rosaceae species: Prunus persica, Prunus dulcis, Prunus mume, Prunus armeniaca, Pyrus ussuriensis \u00d7 Pyrus communis, and Rosa chinensis.NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes of Arabidopsis thaliana were used as controls for phylogenetic analyses. Our analysis revealed the lineage-specific and adaptive evolutions of Rosaceae genes. Our observations indicated the existence of two primary classes of CIPK genes: those that are intron-rich and those that are intron-less. Intronrich CIPKs in Rosaceae and Arabidopsis can be traced back to algae CIPKs and CIPKs found in early plants, suggesting that intron-less CIPKs evolved from their intron-rich counterparts. This study identified one gene for each member of the SOS signaling pathway in P. persica: PpSOS1, PpSOS2, and PpSOS3. Gene expression analyses indicated that all three genes of P. persicawere expressed in roots and leaves.

Floral abundance and richness are known to influence bee foraging behavior, and these factors vary across the landscape, especially across heterogeneous urban extents. This study assesses how floral resources are distributed across the city of Madison, WI and how these factors influence the distribution of foraging bumble bees. We conducted a systematic walking transect survey of bumble bees across Madison, WI. The resulting point location data associated with more than 5,000 non-lethally surveyed bumble bees were analyzed with regard to floral resource explanatory variables as well as underlying land use zoning on more than 700 transects. We used Moran&#039;s \ud835\ude10 correlograms to investigate spatial autocorrelation in floral resource variables and bumble bee counts, then we fitted a generalized linear model predicting transect bee counts based on floral cover, density, species richness and wild plant species richness on the distribution of foraging bees. We employed a geographically-weighted regression model to explore non-stationarity in the effects of floral resource explanatory variables across the study extent. We found significant positive influence of flower cover, species richness, and weakly significant positive influence of wildflower species richness on foraging bee counts within the model as well as a significant positive influence of the land use zoning categorical variable. The effects of floral resource predictors on foraging bumble bees varies based on landscape context across the city. The results of this study show that landscapes with high cover as well as floral diversity maximize bumble bee foraging, and the positive effect of wildflower species richness stands out where floral cover and overall richness are also present. Given that urban landscapes are not homogeneous and that floral resources are not consistently distributed across the cityscape, valuable pollinator habitat should be protected, and supplemented where gaps persist.

Burgeoning new interest in this fruit in both its fresh and processed forms has led to an increase in planting outside of traditional growing zones. Passionfruit production has increased steadily in the United States and its territories since the 2002 US Department of Agriculture Census of Agriculture; however, little is known about how the industry functions across production areas. To assess passionfruit growers\u2019 production practices and support their needs, we conducted a survey during 2021. That survey consisted of 45 questions pertaining to various aspects of passionfruit production, including horticultural practices, pest management, cultivars grown, and industry challenges and needs. The objectives of the survey were to identify where passionfruit is currently grown in the United States, what production practices are being used, and what problems are being encountered so that researchers and extension personnel could provide remedies in the future. Forty-four surveys were complete and allowed for data analyses. Florida had the most responses (21), followed by Puerto Rico (12), California (6), Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Virgin Islands. Most of the passionfruit production in the United States comprises purple passionfruit (\ud835\ude17\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 f. \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34) or intraspecific red types at 68.2%. This value is driven by the high amounts of purple passionfruit and red passionfruit in Florida and other states. In contrast, nearly all farms in Puerto Rico grow yellow passionfruit (\ud835\ude17. \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 f. \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude22) and fewer purple types. The main obstacle to obtaining optimum production was labor availability. Managing passionfruit, like many other specialty crops, is labor-intensive and includes many activities that require manual labor, such as weeding, training, pruning, pollination, and harvesting. Other obstacles that were noted were weather variability, vine decline, poor pollination, and availability of high-quality cultivars. Diseases, especially fungal diseases, are of particular concern to growers of passionfruit in the United States, although the identification of specific diseases was\u00a0limited. Online delivery methods of information ranked high on the list of desired products. Online articles, such as those offered by extension services, were the most preferred, followed by webinars, which comprise a more recently developed method of information delivery. Overall, the survey provided baseline information to further develop initiatives to aid passionfruit production within the United States.

In conclusion, the tested microgreens can be a good source of minerals showing a high potential to address different dietary needs; however, their yield potential and mineral profile are largely determined by the genotype.

We measured dissolved N\u2082:Ar patterns in twelve experimental pond mesocosms representing a N:P gradient ranging from 7 to 835 (molar) that was driven by large differences in NO\u2083-N availability. Mesocosms with NO\u2083-N\u2009&lt;\u20090.1 mg L\u22121 had N\u2082:Ar saturation ratio values consistently below equilibrium (i.e., net N fixation), whereas mesocosms with NO\u2083-N\u2009&gt;\u20091 mg L\u22121 had N\u2082:Ar values consistently above equilibrium (i.e., net denitrification, demonstrating a shift from N\u2082 import to export as pond N availability increased). Both planktonic N fixation estimated from isotope mixing models and N\u2082 fluxes measured by sediment core incubations confirmed a shift from net N fixation to net denitrification as NO\u2083-N concentrations increased. N\u2082:Ar saturation ratio values in the photic zone were negatively correlated with increasing measured N fixation while saturation ratios from benthic waters were positively correlated with increasing sediment N\u2082-N flux.

Studies to investigate host-plant resistance often measure life history characteristics of an individual on the test cultivar. However, aphid lifespan, fecundity, and intrinsic rate of increase could be influenced by the presence and feeding effects of multiple individuals, potentially overestimating antibiosis when a single individual is monitored. We compared life history traits of a single sorghum aphid, Melanaphis sorghi, with life history parameters of groups of 10 females on susceptible sorghum. There were no significant differences between the single and grouped aphids for longevity (P= 0.08; F= 3.67), the number of offspring produced (P=0.59, F =0.31), the time spent in reproduction (P= 0.08; F= 3.74) or the number of offspring per day (P=0.35, F=0.93). Demographics parameters (fecundity rate (Dm) and intrinsic rate of increase (rm) were also not different. Overall, our results indicate that single aphids are suitable to investigate host plant resistance, including antibiosis. When investigations require using groups of aphids, it can be difficult to identify individuals. We investigated using non-toxic permanent markers (black, blue, green and red) to place colored dots on individuals. Survival and reproduction of marked individuals was similar to controls and marks were readable for at least two weeks, demonstrating that permanent markers can be used when an experiment requires following individuals or cohorts that are mixed.

We hypothesized that foliar fungal microbiomes would depend on plant traits and environmental filters, constrained by neighboring vegetation expected to serve as a fungal source. Thus, we sampled foliar fungi from four crops (three annual and one perennial), four sites per crop, and three varieties per annual crop, across a 500-km expanse in North Carolina, USA and tested the role of host traits, environmental traits, and vegetative landcover on foliar fungal community structure. Crop species and site were major determinants of community structure, primarily due to differences in plant size and growing season. Site consistently explained 10\u00d7 more variation in community structure than host variety across the annual crops. Finally, reduced natural vegetative cover surrounding farms was correlated with decreased fungal richness and more homogeneous microbiome assembly. Based on these results, we posit that foliar fungal assembly in crops results from host and environmental filters acting on inputs from the nearby vegetation. Future efforts at agricultural microbiome management must therefore consider landscape management and will require an improved understanding of how agricultural intensification alters microbial source pools.

Twenty parents from 6- to 11-year-old children that qualify for free/reduced school lunch programs completed a survey and interview examining online cooking information seeking behaviors, current cooking practices, and factors that influence healthy eating. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a semi-structured hybrid coding approach. Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) Current cooking habits and environment; (2) Factors that influence healthy cooking; and (3) The role of the internet in home cooking.

At a study site in the southeastern United States, we measured the density of stink bug species and patterns of parasitism and predation on corn, cotton, and soybean and host trees in an adjacent woodline. We assessed parasitism and predation of naturally laid egg masses in crops and sentinel egg masses in host trees and used pheromone-baited traps to determine H. halys seasonal development. Overall, H. halys and N. viridula were the dominant bugs observed. Adult H. halys were first detected each year on trees, followed by corn, and then cotton and soybean, suggesting that trees served as a source of H. halys dispersing into crops. For H. halys, more nymphs were captured in soybean than in corn or cotton. For N. viridula, more adults were captured in corn and cotton than in soybean, and more nymphs were captured in corn during 2019 and 2021 than in 2020. Percentage parasitism of N. viridula egg masses (74.2%) was higher than than that for H. halys egg masses (54.3%). Accordingly, conservation biological control has the potential to enhance parasitism of indigenous stink bugs and H. halys in field crop agroecosystems.

Merr) cover crop, Saccharum monoculture (30+ year) and fallowed soil were determined. Near full length (~1,400 base pairs) of 16S rRNA gene sequences were extracted from the rhizospheres of sugarcane and soybean and fallowed soil were compared. Higher soil bacterial diversity was observed in the soybean cover crop than sugarcane monoculture across all measured indices (observed operationational taxonomic units, Chao1, Shannon, reciprocal Simpson and Jackknife). Acidocateria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes were the most abundant bacterial phyla across the treatments. Indicator species analysis identified nine indicator phyla. Planctomycetes, Armatimonadetes and candidate phylum FBP were associated with soybean; Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were linked with sugarcane and Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Rokubacteria and unclassified bacteria were associated with fallowed soil. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed distinct groupings of bacterial operational taxonomic units (97% identity) according to management system (soybean, sugarcane or fallow) indicating compositional differences among treatments. This is confirmed by the results of the multi-response permutation procedures (A = 0.541, \ud835\ude31 = 0.00045716). No correlation between soil parameters and bacterial community structure was observed according to Mantel test (r = 211865, \ud835\ude31 = 0.14).

From 2015 to 2017, 1,340\u20131,445 females of S. galinae along with males were released into each release plot, paired with a nonrelease control plot (1\u201312.5 km apart), at 6 postinvasion forested sites containing abundant pole-sized ash trees in Michigan. By 2018, S. galinae had spread to all but one control plot. Based on the first year that S. galinae was found in trees in each control plot and the distances of those trees to the parasitoid release point within each site, we estimated that S. galinae spread at 3.7 (\u00b11.9) km per year after its initial releases in 2015. The proportion of sampled trees with S. galinae broods, brood densities within sampled trees, and parasitism of EAB larvae increased sharply in both control and release plots after the last field releases in 2017, with the highest parasitism rates (42.8\u201360.3%) in 2020. Life table analysis showed that S. galinae alone reduced EAB\u2019s net population growth rate by 35\u201355% across sites from 2018 to 2020. These results demonstrate that S. galinae has established an increasing population in Michigan and now plays a significant role in reducing EAB populations in the area.

Gray) is an underutilized drought tolerant annual legume, originating from the Sonoran Desert, that may be a beneficial forage/hay for beef cattle in the Southern Great Plains of the US (SGP). The SGP has erratic rainfall and periods of intermittent drought exacerbated by high summer temperatures. In 2020 and 2021, a split-plot design was used to evaluate 13 genotypes of tepary bean and a forage soybean (control) at El Reno, OK, USA to compare production of plant biomass and forage nutritive value parameters under seven harvest regimes. Genotypes were used as the main plot and cutting management as the sub-plot. Biomass production of all tepary bean genotypes equaled that of soybean (\ud835\ude31\u2009&gt;\u20090.05), while several genotypes had superior forage nutritive value traits (\ud835\ude31\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). Overall, a 15-cm cutting height and 30-day harvest interval produced the best overall product (average dry biomass of 5.8\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u207b\u00b9 with average relative feed values (RFV) of 165). Although all harvest regimes reduced total seasonal biomass, forage nutritive value increased. However, the tradeoff between forage production and nutritive value may be unacceptable to most producers. Further agronomic and breeding research is needed to encourage producers to grow tepary bean as a forage/hay in the SGP.

Variants were selected based on functional impact and were partitioned into four groups (low, modifier, moderate, high) based on predicted functional impact and re-partitioned based on the consequence of mutation, such as missense and untranslated region variants, into six groups (G1-G6). Each subset was used to construct a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) for univariate animal models. Multiple analyses were conducted to compare the proportion of additive genetic variation explained by the different subsets individually and collectively, and these estimates were benchmarked against all LPS variants in a single GRM and array (e.g., GeneSeek Genomic Profiler 100K) genotypes. When all variants were included in a single GRM, heritability estimates for BWT and PWG were 0.43\u2005\u00b1\u20050.05 and 0.38\u2005\u00b1\u20050.05, respectively. Heritability estimates for BWT ranged from 0.10 to 0.42 dependent on which variant subsets were included. Similarly, estimates for PWG ranged from 0.05 to 0.38. Results showed that variants in the subsets modifier and G1 (untranslated region) yielded the highest heritability estimates and were similar to the inclusion of all variants, while estimates from GRM containing only variants in the categories High, G4 (non-coding transcript exon), and G6 (start and stop loss/gain) were the lowest. All variants combined provided similar heritability estimates to chip genotypes and provided minimal to no additional information when combined with chip data. This suggests that the chip single nucleotide polymorphisms and the variants from LPS predicted to be less consequential are in relatively high linkage disequilibrium with the underlying causal variants as a whole and sufficiently spread throughout the genome to capture larger proportions of additive genetic variation.

WSMV determinants responsible for wheat streak mosaic disease in wheat are unknown. Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), a wheat-infecting virus, was used as an expression vector for the transient expression of each of the WSMV-encoded cistrons in wheat. WSMV-encoded 6K1, NIa-VPg, NIa-Pro, and CP cistrons in TriMV elicited symptoms specific to different stages of wheat streak mosaic disease without significantly affecting the genomic RNA accumulation. WSMV 6K1 produced early wheat streak mosaic disease-like symptoms of severe chlorotic streaks and patches. NIa-VPg and CP caused severe chlorotic streaks, followed by moderate stunting (only with NIa-VPg) of wheat, mimicking early- and mid-stage symptoms of wheat streak mosaic disease. WSMV NIa-Pro caused mild chlorotic streaks, followed by dark green leaves with severe stunting, representing the late symptoms of wheat streak mosaic disease. Collectively, these data suggest that cumulative effects of WSMV-encoded 6K1, NIa-VPg, NIa-Pro, and CP are responsible for different stages of wheat streak mosaic disease symptoms in wheat. Furthermore, deletion analysis of wheat streak mosaic disease determinants revealed that complete 6K1 and NIa-Pro, amino acids 3 to 60 and 121 to 197 of NIa-VPg, and amino acids 101 to 294 of CP are responsible for wheat streak mosaic disease-like symptoms in wheat.

The thurberia weevil is generally regarded as a non-pest variant of the species, whereas the boll weevil is an important economic pest of commercial cotton. In the USA, a nationwide eradication program has been largely successful against the boll weevil, but reintroductions of eradicated zones remain a threat. In 2015, \ud835\ude08. \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 was trapped in the functionally eradicated Winter Garden growing region in Texas, where it had not been found since 2012. Weevils established in the area and triggered a multi-year, multi-million-dollar mitigation effort. In 2017, the species was trapped in Hidalgo County, New Mexico, another area where it had been previously eradicated. In this study, we obtained specimens from both trapping events and used double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to obtain genetic data in homology with previously published \ud835\ude08. \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34 population genetic data. We conducted source tracing to match the captured weevils to previously described populations to determine a likely source population. We also compared the accuracy of the approach to other diagnostic methods currently used by the United States Department of Agriculture. The results suggested that a small founder population of weevils dispersed from the Lower Rio Grande Valley population in southern Texas and northern Tamaulipas and established in the Winter Garden. In Hidalgo Co., NM, the weevils were found to be genetically indistinct from non-pest populations of thurberia weevil associated with Arizona wild cotton (\ud835\ude0e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2e \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a). Thurberia weevils in Arizona remain unlikely to threaten commercial growers. Improved rapid diagnostic tools may be desirable to enable better assessment of trap captures and allow for a reduction in the application of mitigation efforts when the non-pest variant is identified.

This research demonstrates the evaluation and comparison of thermal and kinetic properties of bio-lubricants synthesized from naturally derived fatty acids. The oxidative stability of the vegetable oil-based bio-lubricants affects their storage stability and reusability. Five different types of bio-lubricants were previously synthesized from oleic acid, iso-oleic acid, and iso-stearic acid. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted in the presence of air and nitrogen. Comparative studies of the kinetic parameters under thermal decomposition of each synthesized product show that these bio-lubricants are thermally stable. The calculated activation energy showed that trimethylolpropane iso-oleic acid triester (TMP-IOA) was thermally stable with an average activation energy E\u2090 = 188.4 kJ/mol in an inert environment (Under N\u2082). In the oxidative environment (under air), trimethylolpropane iso-stearic acid triester (TMP-ISA) was found as the most stable bio-lubricant with an E\u2090= 109.8 kJ/mol. The glyceride-iso-oleic acid triester (GLY-IOA) showed a high range frequency factor indicating complex behavior in an air environment. Among these lubricants, the GLY-IOA exhibited superior cold flow properties as measured using cryogenic differential scanning calorimetry. Overall, these comparative studies confirm that the lubricant-based oils produced using saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid provide a good combination of thermal and oxidative stability along with cold flow properties.", "publication_date": "2023-11-15", "date_other": "", "volume": 204, "issue": "Part B", "first_page": 117315, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20405095%20-%20SARKER%20REPRINT%208-30-2023%20PAC.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 439256, "log_number": 405095, "created": 1694174102, "changed": 1710016394}, {"submission_node_id": 716, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

We isolated a bacterium named YL-RY0310, which inhibited the growth of P. expansum and production of PAT in apples by 77.4% and 48.4%, respectively. Strain YL-RY0310 was 96% homologous to Bacillus mojavensis using morphological and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses. In addition, DNA amplification analysis using Bacillus-specific primers showed that the genes responsible for synthesis of lipopeptides of surfactin, iturins and fengycin are expressed. Oxford cup agar diffusion test showed that its crude lipopeptides could effectively inhibit the growth of P. expansum. Furthermore, strain YL-RY0310 could significantly degrade PAT; the degradation efficiencies of the intracellular and extracellular metabolites of the strain were 62.6% and 56.9%, respectively. Therefore, B. mojavensis YL-RY0310 could be used as a biocontrol agent to inhibit the growth of P. expansum and control PAT contamination in apples.

A cohort of weaned calves (10 animals/group) were randomized to receive a feed ration with or without tylosin.

Enumeration and binary outcomes were analyzed by mixed effects linear regression or logistic regression, respectively, using treatment and days on feed as fixed factors, and animal ID as a random variable. Tylosin supplementation did not affect the fecal concentrations of TET\u02b3 E. coli or fecal prevalence of 3GC\u02b3 E. coli. However, cattle in the tylosin group were 1.5 times more likely (Odds ratio = 1.5: 95% confidence interval: 1.1\u20132.0) to harbor ESBLs E. coli than the control cattle. Regardless of tylosin treatment, fecal concentrations of TET\u02b3 E. coli and the prevalence of 3GC\u02b3- and ESBLs-E. coli increased over time.

The study explored the use of the random forest regression (RFR), a supervised machine learning (ML) model, as an alternative to the physically based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting streamflow in the Rio Grande Headwaters near Del Norte, a snowmelt-dominated mountainous watershed of the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Remotely sensed data were used for the random forest machine learning analysis (RFML) and RStudio for data processing and synthesizing. The RFML model outperformed the SWAT model in accuracy and demonstrated its capability in predicting streamflow in this region. We implemented a customized approach to the RFR model to assess the model\u2019s performance for three training periods, across 1991\u20132010, 1996\u20132010, and 2001\u20132010; the results indicated that the model\u2019s accuracy improved with longer training periods, implying that the model trained on a more extended period is better able to capture the parameters\u2019 variability and reproduce streamflow data more accurately. The variable importance (i.e., IncNodePurity) measure of the RFML model revealed that the snow depth and the minimum temperature were consistently the top two predictors across all training periods. The paper also evaluated how well the SWAT model performs in reproducing streamflow data of the watershed with a conventional approach. The SWAT model needed more time and data to set up and calibrate, delivering acceptable performance in annual mean streamflow simulation, with satisfactory index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), and percent bias (PBIAS) values, but monthly simulation warrants further exploration and model adjustments. The study recommends exploring snowmelt runoff hydrologic processes, dust-driven sublimation effects, and more detailed topographic input parameters to update the SWAT snowmelt routine for better monthly flow estimation. The results provide a critical analysis for enhancing streamflow prediction, which is valuable for further research and water resource management, including snowmelt-driven semi-arid regions.

Systematic profiling of the RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) is thus indispensable for researchers aiming to understand the mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation. RBPome identification methods developed in humans, mice, and bacteria have successfully identified RBPomes in these organisms. However, the biochemical and genetic complexities of plant tissues have greatly hindered the effectiveness of these methods in plants. Moreover, plant RBPs have been predominantly discovered through oligo d(T) based affinity purification (RNA-interactome capture). Since polyadenylated RNA only accounts for less than 5% of the total RNA population in eukaryotic cells, there is a pressing need to develop a comprehensive, yet unbiased, method to capture the full spectrum of RBPs in plants. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of Plant Phase Extraction (PPE), a recently developed method to identify RBPs in Arabidopsis (Zhang Y, Xu Y, Skaggs TH, et al. Plant phase extraction: a method for enhanced discovery of the RNA-binding proteome and its dynamics in plants. Plant Cell 2023; 35: 2750\u201372.) [1]. The PPE method enables the efficient enrichment of both poly(A) and non-poly(A) RBPs from various tissues quickly and reproducibly. Most importantly, PPE allows for unveiling dynamic RBP\u2013RNA interactions under various abiotic and biotic stress conditions and during different plant developmental stages. This provides a much broader and more accurate understanding of plant RBPs, marking a significant advancement in plant molecular biology.

Symptoms of PHRD were observed in all fields evaluated, except at the Agricultural Experiment Substation in Isabela. Diseased plant tissue was surface disinfected and plated on PARPH-V8 selective media for Phytophthora spp. Aerial photography using a DJI Phantom 3 drone was used to corroborate PHRD incidence in the field. Approximately eight hectares were infected by P. nicotianae with an average of PHRD disease incidence of 28.82%. The highest percentage of PHRD incidence was observed in fields located at Gu\u00e1nica, Lajas and Manat\u00ed with 40%, 40% and 30%, respectively. Eleven isolates of Phytophthora nicotianae were collected from pineapple fields in Gu\u00e1nica, Lajas, Manat\u00ed and Santa Isabel and identified using morphology and phylogeny of sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I region (COI).

leader in weed science research covering topics ranging from the development and use of integrated weed management (IWM) tactics to basic mechanistic studies, including biotic resistance of desirable plant communities and herbicide resistance. ARS weed scientists have worked in agricultural and natural ecosystems, including agronomic and horticultural crops, pastures, forests, wild lands, aquatic habitats, wetlands, and riparian areas. Through strong partnerships with academia, state agencies, private industry, and numerous federal programs, ARS weed scientists have made contributions to discoveries in the newest fields of robotics and genetics, as well as the traditional and fundamental subjects of weed\u2013crop competition and physiology and integration of weed control tactics and practices. Weed science at ARS is often overshadowed by other research topics; thus, few are aware of the long history of ARS weed science and its important contributions. This review is the result of a symposium held at the Weed Science Society of America\u2019s 62nd Annual Meeting in 2022 that included 10 separate presentations in a virtual Weed Science Webinar Series. The overarching themes of management tactics (IWM, biological control, and automation), basic mechanisms (competition, invasive plant genetics, and herbicide resistance), and ecosystem impacts (invasive plant spread, climate change, conservation, and restoration) represent core ARS weed science research that is dynamic and efficacious and has been a significant component of the agency\u2019s national and international efforts. This review highlights current studies and future directions that exemplify the science and collaborative relationships both within and outside ARS. Given the constraints of weeds and invasive plants on all aspects of food, feed, and fiber systems, there is an acknowledged need to face new challenges, including agriculture and natural resources sustainability, economic resilience and reliability, and societal health and well-being.

In that study, only two levels of CO\u2082 (400, 700 ppm) and temperature (30, 37 \u00b0C) were tested in young vegetative plants, and the underlying mechanism for warming + eCO\u2082 hyponasty was not investigated. In this study, warming + eCO\u2082 hyponasty was evaluated in tomato across a range of temperatures and CO\u2082 concentrations, and at multiple life stages. Based on their roles in thermal hyponasty, ethylene and auxin tomato mutants were examined, and light quality manipulated, to explore the mechanism for warming + eCO\u2082 hyponasty. At eCO\u2082 (800 ppm), the petiole angle increased roughly linearly with temperature from 30 to 38 \u00b0C. Under high temperature stress (38 \u00b0C), the petiole angle increased similarly at all eCO\u2082 concentrations (600/800/1000 vs. 400 ppm). All life stages examined had an increased petiole angle in leaves developed during warming + eCO\u2082, such that most leaves in juvenile plants exhibited hyponasty but only young growing leaves did so in adults. Auxin-insensitive mutants displayed a reduced petiole angle compared to auxin-sensitive, ethylene-sensitive, ethylene-insensitive, and non-mutant genotypes, indicating that auxin, but not ethylene, is likely a main component of this hyponastic response. Reduced far-red-to-red light plus increased blue light reduced petiole hyponasty compared to non-filtered white light during warming + eCO\u2082.

In 3 repetitions, Holstein heifer calves (n = 30; 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 d old; 37.1 \u00b1 0.86 kg body weight) were blocked by serum total protein, body weight, and age, and provided MR (3.8 L/calf per d; 24% CP, 17% fat, 12.5% solids) supplemented with L-glutamine (GLN; 10g/kg MR powder; n = 5 calves/repetition) or nonsupplemented (NSMR; n = 5 calves/repetition).

Adoption of conservation practices, such as cover crops and woodchip bioreactors, can significantly reduce nitrate losses and improve water quality. However, the long-term performance of these conservation practices and their effect on water quality has not been sufficiently quantified. A replicated plot experiment was initiated to quantify the long-term effectiveness of such conservation practices on nitrate-N removal rates from subsurface tile drains. Maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) were grown with three different treatments: 1) Control: no-till crop production, 2) no-till with a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop (RC), and 3) no-till with an in-situ woodchip denitrification wall (DW) where trenches were excavated parallel to the tile on both sides and filled with woodchips to serve as additional carbon sources to increase denitrification. During a period of 19 years (2002\u20132020), all three treatments received the same annual N fertilization in maize years with rates ranging from 168 to 247 kg N/ha, depending on the production year. Averaged across the 19 years, the RC and DW treatments reduced N leaching by 59% and 58%, respectively, compared with the Control. Both conservation practices were effective for the duration of the study, and both were affected by annual rainfall. Effectiveness of RC increased in dry years, while effectiveness of DW increased in wet years. Overall, treatment and annual precipitation had the greatest effects on annual N loss in drainage. This suggests that the unpredictability of rainfall may make it difficult to consistently reduce nitrate losses in drainage, but it does not diminish the effectiveness of conservation practices. Minimal or no yield penalty was observed following adoption of cover crop or in-situ woodchip bioreactor conservation practices, which is important for their wider acceptance by the agriculture community.", "publication_date": "2023-10-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 288, "issue": "", "first_page": 108481, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20403681%20-%20403681%20Rogovska.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 441902, "log_number": 403681, "created": 1694174179, "changed": 1710016076}, {"submission_node_id": 748, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

However, forests also have relatively low albedo compared to grass and croplands, which increases the amount of solar energy they absorb into the climate system. An alternative natural climate solution is to replace fossil fuels with bioenergy. Bioenergy crops such as switchgrass have higher albedo than forest ecosystems but absorb less total carbon over their lifetime. To evaluate trade-offs in the mitigation potential by pine and switchgrass ecosystems, we used eddy covariance net ecosystem exchange and albedo observations collected from planted pine forests and switchgrass fields in eastern North America and Canada to compare the net radiative forcing of these two ecosystems over the length of typical pine rotation (30 years). We found that pine had a net positive radiative forcing (warming) of 5.4 \u00b1 2.8 \ud835\ude1e\ud835\ude2e\u207b\u00b2 when albedo and carbon were combined together (30 year mean). However the assumptions regarding the fate of harvested carbon had an important effect on the net radiative forcing. When we assumed all switchgrass carbon was emitted to the atmosphere while the harvested pine carbon was prevented from entering the atmosphere, the 30-year mean net radiative forcing reversed direction (\u22123.6 \u00b1 2.8 \ud835\ude1e\ud835\ude2e\u207b\u00b2).

Its competitive nature and early spring growth give it an advantage over native cool season grasses. This early and prolific growth provides forage for livestock but eventually leads to a decrease in other plant species and to negative impacts to multiple ecosystem services. Developing effective landscape-scale management techniques for invasives like Kentucky bluegrass depends on understanding the perceptions, coping capacity, and management abilities of private landowners. Through a mail survey conducted in North Dakota, this research provides insight into the cognitive processes that motivate agricultural landowners to manage Kentucky bluegrass and investigates psychological factors that constrain or enable the implementation of management behaviors. The results showed that less than half of the landowners surveyed had a management goal for Kentucky bluegrass, and among those with such goals, the perceived capacity to cope with the species was moderate to low. The majority of landowners who wanted to decrease the abundance of Kentucky bluegrass on their rangelands did not believe they could effectively do so. This highlights the need for the rangeland science and extension community to develop effective and feasible management techniques and conservation programs that integrate research findings to provide viable solutions. Participatory processes that include diverse interested and affected parties and rights holders can provide social learning environments conducive to the joint exploration of problems and refinement of actionable solutions.

The removal of many antimicrobials in poultry diets has driven the search for alternatives. The purpose of this study was to determine the microbiota changes in the cecal luminal (CE-L) and mucosal (CE-M) populations of broiler chickens undergoing clinical NE (co-infected with Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens) while fed a diet containing a flavonoid rich corn (PennHFD1) or control diet using commercial corns. It was previously shown that chickens fed a diet high in flavonoids had improved performance parameters, lower mortality rate, and lower incidence of intestinal lesions. Flavonoids have been shown to have anti-bacterial, immuno-modulatory, and anti-inflammatory activity. The current study included four experimental groups: infected chickens fed commercial corn diet (CTRL-A) or PennHFD1 (CTRL-B) and infected chickens fed commercial corn diet (IF-A) or PennHFD1 (IF-B). We found that most of the microbiota changes were due to infection rather than diet. The alpha diversity in the IF chickens was lower in both CE-L and CE-M. The beta diversity of microbial communities was different between IF and CTRL chickens, as well as between CTRL-A and CTRL-B. The beta diversity of CTRL birds was more homogenous compared to IF samples. Taxonomic analysis showed a decrease in short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in IF birds. An increase in lactic acid producing bacteria, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus cecorum was also observed in IF birds. It is possible that the effect of the high flavonoid corn on the microbiota was overcome by the effect of NE, or that the positive effects of increased flavonoids in NE-challenged birds are a result of mechanisms which do not involve the microbiota. The effects of high flavonoid corn on NE infections may be further investigated as a possible alternative to antimicrobials.", "publication_date": "2023-10-25", "date_other": "", "volume": 2, "issue": "", "first_page": 1212130, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20403805%20-%20403805_Miska%20et%20al_2023_Front%20Microbiomes_2_1212130.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 442615, "log_number": 403805, "created": 1698842946, "changed": 1710015830}, {"submission_node_id": 898, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

The literature presents contradictory results about the efficacy of using RUSLE in a GIS context for quantifying reservoir sedimentation, requiring further evaluation and validation of its estimates relative to measured reservoir sedimentation. Our primary objective was to determine if these contradictory results may be a function of the RUSLE\u2019s inability to account for sediments derived from gullies, stream channels, or stream banks; the temporal variability of some of RUSLE\u2019s empirically based factors such as the land cover/land management (C-) factor; and in some model renditions, the choice of value for the sediment delivery ratio (SDR). The usefulness of adjusting these estimates using a regional representative value of gully/stream bank sediment contributions was also assessed. High-spatial horizontal resolution (2 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) for 12 watersheds were used together with C-factor data for five representative years in a GIS-based RUSLE model that incorporates SDR within a sediment routing routine to study the impacts of choice of C-factor and SDR on reservoir sedimentation estimates. Choice of image date for developing C-factors was found to impact reservoir estimates. We also found that the value of SDR for some of the study watersheds would have to be unrealistically small to produce sedimentation estimates comparable to measured values. Estimates of reservoir sedimentation were comparable to measured data for 5 of the 12 watersheds, when the regionally based adjustment for gully/stream bank contributions was applied. However, differences remained large for the remaining seven watersheds. Statistical analysis revealed that certain combinations of geomorphic, pedologic, or topographic variables could be used to predict the degree of sediment underestimation with a significant and high level of correlation (0.72 &lt; R\u00b2 \u2264 0.99; p-value &lt; 0.05). Our findings indicate that the level of agreement between GIS-based RUSLE estimates of reservoir sedimentation and measured values is a function of watershed characteristics; for example, the area-weighted soil erodibility (K-) factor of the soils within the watershed and stream channels, the stream entrenchment ratio and bank full depth, the percentage of the stream corridor having slopes \u2265 21\u00b0, and the width of the stream flood way as a percentage of the watershed area.

Currently, hop lacks a rapid and accurate diagnostic marker to determine whether plants are male or female. Without a diagnostic marker, breeding programs may take 1\u20132 years to determine the sex of new seedlings. Previous research on sex-linked markers was restricted to specific populations or breeding programs and therefore had limited transferability or suffered from low scalability. A large collection of 765 hop genotypes with known sex phenotypes, genotyping-by-sequencing, and genome-wide association mapping revealed a highly significant marker on the sex chromosome (LOD score = 208.7) that predicted sex within our population with 96.2% accuracy. In this study, we developed a PCR allele competitive extension (PACE) assay for the diagnostic SNP and tested three quick DNA extraction methodologies for rapid, high-throughput genotyping. Additionally, the marker was validated in a separate population of 94 individuals from 15 families from the USDA-ARS hop breeding program in Prosser, WA with 96% accuracy. This diagnostic marker is located in a gene predicted to encode the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor protein, a family of proteins that have been previously implicated in male sterility in a variety of plant species, which may indicate a role in determining hop sex. The marker is diagnostic, accurate, affordable, and highly scalable and has the potential to improve efficiency in hop breeding.

Ensuring autumn emergence of pennycress after early broadcast seeding is key because this practice may result in uneven spatial distribution due to the small seed size and variable germination, soil contact, and moisture availability. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of five seed treatments and enhancements on autumn establishment in two pennycress lines (MN106NS and tt8-t/ARV1) in broadcast seeding compared with no treatment.MethodsTested treatments were (i) gibberellic acid (GA) soak, (ii) fludioxonil fungicide, (iii) pelleting with diatomaceous earth and a commercial binder, (iv) fungicide plus pelleting, or (v) fungicide plus pelleting with GA added to the binder. Seeds were planted at nine sites in four U.S. states to assess establishment (stand counts and percentage canopy cover) in the autumn and spring and seed yield after maturity.ResultsThe MN106NS line had greater plants m\u207b\u00b2 and percent green cover with treatments that included GA compared to the control. Line tt8-t/ARV1 had reduced stands when pelleted compared to the untreated, and establishment was unchanged when treated with GA compared to the untreated. Pelleting treatments without GA were not beneficial for stand establishment of either line. Seed yield for MN106NS was 20% greater than the untreated when treated with GA only or pelleted. Seed yield for tt8-t/ARV1 did not increase over the untreated with any treatment and was reduced by 20%\u201340% when pelleted.DiscussionThese results suggest minimal benefit of seed treatment and pelleting for the tested lines under broadcast seeding, though black-seeded lines may still benefit from GA treatment. Plant establishment and yield were negatively correlated with total precipitation post-planting, suggesting that excessive rainfall post-planting (&amp;gt;60\u00a0mm) may impede establishment when broadcast seeded.

A mixed-mode survey of decision-makers representing the US nursery industry was conducted in 2021. The survey assessed practices used in 2020 to elicit a better understanding of nursery approaches to the challenges presented by persistent labor scarcity. We compare our results to survey data collected approximately 15 years prior at container nurseries. Survey responses revealed that nurseries were undertaking strategies that aimed to improve production efficiency, better recruit and retain employees, and secure other sources of labor to overcome this shortage. Specifically, more than 65% of surveyed US nurseries increased worker wages and more than 55% of respondents adopted automation to address the labor shortage. Strategies in use by \u226523% of respondents may limit future growth or jeopardize long-term nursery survival. These include diversifying tasks of current employees, reducing production of labor-intensive plants, or delaying expansion plans. Survey results suggested that production tasks excluding irrigation were on average 31% automated or mechanized at container nurseries, an increase from 16% during the prior survey. Field nurseries were 35% automated or mechanized in 2020.

Materials and Methods: Sixteen Angus heifers were housed in individual pens. Four animals were assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 4 x 4 Latin square experimental design with 14-d periods consisting of a 6-d baseline period to measure feed intake and 8 d of sample and data collection. Heifers were fed once daily starting at 2.5% of BW and each subsequent day at 5% above previous day intake.

Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts on activated carbon supports (Ni/AC, Fe/AC, Ni-Fe/AC) are compared during methane pyrolysis testing. Catalytic methane pyrolysis was carried out in a microwave reactor at reaction temperatures of 600 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C. For comparison, one of the catalysts (Ni-Fe/AC) was tested in a conventionally heated reactor at 800 \u00b0C. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while post-reaction catalysts were characterized by XRD and SEM. During reaction testing, the monometallic Ni/AC catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity (CH4 conversion: 46.0 and H2 yield: 46.9%) when reacted in the microwave reactor, however, it suffered from rapid deactivation from carbon deposition (carbon yield: 0.39 g C/g catalyst). The bimetallic Ni-Fe/AC catalyst was slightly less active (CH4 conversion: 36.9 and H2 yield: 40.5%) but it was more resistant to carbon formation (carbon yield: 0.27 g C/g catalyst) suggesting it may have greater long-term stability. The Ni-Fe/AC catalyst was also the most energy efficient as it required the least microwave power to maintain the 800 \u00b0C reaction temperature compared to the other catalysts tested. Methane conversion of the bimetallic Ni-Fe/AC at 800 \u00b0C under microwave irradiation was three times the conversion under conventional heating at the same reaction temperature.

Bacteria are important components of pond ecology and play integral roles in nutrient cycling, disease, and the dissolved oxygen budget of commercial catfish ponds. Profiling pond water microbiota can be useful for understanding what conditions may lead to microbial communities associated with disease or off-flavor and could inform management practices. The aim of this study was to identify appropriate methods for bacterial community profiling of catfish pond water with nanopore sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. To this end, two forward primers (27F, 27F_mod), two reverse primers (1492R, 1525R), and three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle numbers (10, 15 and 20 cycles) were tested on a mock community consisting of aquaculture-relevant bacteria. Results indicated a combination of forward primer 27F_mod and reverse primer 1492R, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles, yielded results most consistent with the theoretical composition of the mock.

There is a continual shift toward machine learning (ML)-based approaches for automating agricultural pest detection. Although supervised learning has achieved remarkable progress in this regard, it is impeded by the need for significant expert involvement in labeling the data used for model training. This makes real-world applications tedious and oftentimes infeasible. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have provided a viable alternative to training ML models with minimal annotations. Here, we present an SSL approach to classify 22 insect pests. The framework was assessed on raw and segmented field-captured images using three different SSL methods, Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (NNCLR), Bootstrap Your Own Latent, and Barlow Twins. SSL pre-training was done on ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models using all three SSL methods on the original RGB images and foreground segmented images. The performance of SSL pre-training methods was evaluated using linear probing of SSL representations and end-to-end fine-tuning approaches. The SSL-pre-trained convolutional neural network models were able to perform annotation-efficient classification. NNCLR was the best performing SSL method for both linear and full model fine-tuning. With just 5% annotated images, transfer learning with ImageNet initialization obtained 74% accuracy, whereas NNCLR achieved an improved classification accuracy of 79% for end-to-end fine-tuning. Models created using SSL pre-training consistently performed better, especially under very low annotation, and were robust to object class imbalances. These approaches help overcome annotation bottlenecks and are resource efficient.", "publication_date": "2023-01-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 6, "issue": 1, "first_page": "e20079", "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20401878%20-%20AbelC_115_Log401878%20official%20manuscript.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 439192, "log_number": 401878, "created": 1691585650, "changed": 1710015283}, {"submission_node_id": 1207, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

N addition increased leaf-N concentrations whereas decreased leaf C:N ratios of all four species, but only the values for two graminoid species were significantly influenced by P addition. Leaf-P concentrations significantly increased for graminoids but significantly decreased for forbs with the application of N. VPA analysis revealed that aboveground components, especially in grass leaves, explained more variation in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) than root and soil components. For grasses, leaf-N concentrations showed high association with ANPP, while leaf-P concentrations were associated with BNPP.

TriMV with complete deletion of HC-Pro cistron elicited systemic infection in wheat, indicating that HC-Pro cistron is dispensable for TriMV systemic infection. However, TriMV lacking HC-Pro caused delayed systemic infection with mild symptoms that resulted in little or no stunting of plants with a significant reduction in the accumulation of genomic RNA copies and coat protein (CP). Sequential deletion mutagenesis from the 5\u2032 end of HC-Pro cistron in the TriMV genome revealed that deletions within amino acids 3 to 25, except for amino acids 3 and 4, elicited mild symptoms with reduced accumulation of genomic RNA and CP. Surprisingly, TriMV with deletion of amino acids 3 to 50 or 3 to 125 in HC-Pro elicited severe symptoms with a substantial increase in genomic RNA copies but a drastic reduction in CP accumulation. Additionally, TriMV with heterologous HC-Pro from other potyvirids produced symptom phenotype and genomic RNA accumulation similar to that of TriMV without HC-Pro, suggesting that HC-Pros of other potyvirids were not effective in complementing TriMV in wheat.

The reaction kinetics fit a pseudo-first-order reaction with distinct fast and slow phases. The baseline reactions were pH 7.2 at 23 \u00b0C. Adjusting pH to 4.5 or 9.0 increased the reaction rates. Decreasing the temperature to 4.0 \u00b0C reduced the reaction kinetics, while raising the temperature to 40 \u00b0C increased the arsenite oxidation rate. pH and temperature changes alter the reaction kinetics due to shifts related to the point of zero charge, the total system energy, and surface passivation from adsorbing arsenic and manganese species. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping indicates arsenic only penetrates the surficial layers of most manganese-oxide-containing nodules found in the soil. After the arsenite oxidation reaction in the pedogenically weathered subsoil, X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates significant differences in the average manganese oxidation number between the nodules\u2019 outer layers compared to the soil matrix and nodule centers. The kinetic and sorption parameters give critical insight into determining the mobility and species of arsenic and other redox-sensitive contaminants in manganese-containing environmental systems over appropriate timescales.", "publication_date": "2024-01-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 441, "issue": "", "first_page": 116715, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20397107%20-%20397107_Fishchel%20Maniscript_12_26_23%20%282%29.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 440891, "log_number": 397107, "created": 1705435827, "changed": 1710015123}, {"submission_node_id": 1213, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

The codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is a global pest of apple, pear, and walnut, and semiochemically based management strategies limit the economic impacts of this species. The previous report of expression of a candidate pheromone-responsive OR in female codling moth ovipositor and pheromone glands raises further questions about the chemosensory capacity of these organs. With an RNA-sequencing approach, we examined chemoreceptors\u2019 expression in the female codling moth abdomen tip, sampling tissues from mated and unmated females and pupae. We report 37 ORs, 22 GRs, and 18 IRs expressed in our transcriptome showing overlap with receptors expressed in adult antennae as well as non-antennal candidate receptors. A quantitative PCR approach was also taken to assess the effect of mating on OR expression in adult female moths, revealing a few genes to be upregulated or downregulating after mating. These results provide a better understanding of the chemosensory role of codling moth female abdomen tip organs in female-specific behaviors. Future research will determine the function of specific receptors to augment current semiochemical-based strategies for codling moth management.

However, in\u2010situ measurements are operationally limited, and few density models have seen extensive evaluation.

These scripts are designed to be used together to maximize the utility of the available data. These tools were validated on a biparental population of wheat that was genotyped through GBS. They successfully enabled haplotype determination of a locus that was difficult to directly genotype, and their systemic accuracy was demonstrated in multiple populations and species.

The model provided great accuracy (coefficient of determination: 0.96; root\u2010mean square error: 7.8; and mean absolute deviation: 3.8) and explained nearly 96% of variations in soil respiration across soil depth, crop, and slope positions. Soil depth, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH\u2084\u2010N), crop types, slope position, and silt content were identified as the top five factors influencing potential soil respiration at the field level. Potential soil respiration was more sensitive to potassium, phosphorus, pH, cation exchange capacity, and mean weight diameter and less sensitive to NH\u2084\u2010N, nitrate nitrogen, soil organic matter, and clay content. It increased with pH, electrical conductivity, mean weight diameter, potential nitrogen mineralization, and potassium, and it decreased with increasing silt content. Soil from 0 to 5\u00a0cm under soybean or at the summit slope position exhibited a higher respiration. Using a small dataset, this pilot study accurately predicted potential soil respiration in agricultural fields and identified key drivers controlling it. The results from this study highlight the complexity of using potential soil respiration as a standalone test for evaluating soil health. This does not diminish the usefulness of potential soil respiration as a soil health indicator to support agricultural management decisions and as a reference in future soil health studies. However, it emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors when interpreting the significance of soil biological indicators for soil health assessments.

High levels of biomass production and extensive tillage have degraded portions of the state&#039;s alluvial soils used to grow sugarcane. In addition to sucrose, processing the crop generates excess bagasse each year, which can represent a disposal problem for sugar factories. However, converting the bagasse to biochar at nearby pyrolysis facilities may prove to be an economical means of improving degraded soils. The objective was to determine the impacts of low rates of biochar (&lt;3.2 mt ha\u207b\u00b9) on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Plant available nutrient levels were marginally impacted by biochar additions as the biochar exhibited a relatively low surface area and neutral pH.

Because Mormon crickets commonly occur with grasshoppers that feed on the same plants, we investigated interactions between grasshoppers and Mormon crickets, and hypothesized that if Mormon crickets are predatory on grasshoppers, grasshopper abundance would influence the protein available to Mormon crickets and their immunity. In a field setting, we varied densities of Mormon crickets (0, 10, or 20 per cage) and grasshoppers Melanoplus borealis (0, 15, 30, or 45) in 68 1-m\u00b2 cages. After one month, we measured Mormon cricket dietary preferences and PO activity. As predicted, artificial diet consumption shifted away from protein as grasshopper density increased, and immunocompetence, as measured by PO activity, also increased with grasshopper availability. Although nitrogen availability in the vegetation decreased with increasing insect density, predation became an important source of protein for Mormon crickets that enhanced immunity.

Rice has been shown to accumulate alarmingly high concentrations of toxic elements, such as cadmium. Cadmium in foods can lead to renal failure, bone mineral density loss, cancer, and significant neurotoxicological effects. Several strategies to limit cadmium and increase micronutrient density in staple food crops like rice have been explored, but even when cadmium concentrations are reduced by a management strategy, total cadmium levels in rice grain are an unreliable means of estimating human health risk because only a fraction of the minerals in grains are bioaccessible. The goal of this work was to assess the influence of cadmium and zinc supplied to plant roots on the bioaccessibility of cadmium and essential minerals from grains of three rice lines (GSOR 310546/low grain Cd, GSOR 311667/medium grain Cd, and GSOR 310428/high grain Cd) that differed in grain cadmium accumulation. Treatments consisted of 0 \u03bcM Cd + 2 \u03bcM Zn (c0z2), 1 \u03bcM Cd + 2 \u03bcM Zn (c1z2), or 1 \u03bcM Cd + 10 \u03bcM Zn (c1z10). Our results revealed that an increased grain cadmium concentration does not always correlate with increased cadmium bioaccessibility. Among the three rice lines tested, Cd bioaccessibility increased from 2.5% in grains from the c1z2 treatment to 17.7% in grains from the c1z10 treatment. Furthermore, Cd bioccessibility in the low-Cd-accumulating line was significantly higher than the high line in c1z10 treatment. Zinc bioaccessibility increased in the high-cadmium-accumulating line when cadmium was elevated in grains, and in the low-cadmium line when both cadmium and zinc were increased in the rice grains. Our results showed that both exogenous cadmium and elevated zinc treatments increased the bioaccessibility of other minerals from grains of the low- or high-grain cadmium lines of rice. Differences in mineral bioaccessibility were dependent on rice line. Calculations also showed that increased cadmium bioaccessibility correlated with increased risk of dietary exposure to consumers. Furthermore, our results suggest that zinc fertilization increased dietary exposure to cadmium in both high and low lines.

The hypothesis that BSF larval powder was suitable food to support the growth, development, and reproduction of Cmac was tested in the laboratory. When compared to a standard in-house diet containing brine shrimp egg powder plus Chlorella\u00a0vulgaris green algae and myristic acid (BSE+CM), the BSF and BSF+CM diets reduced immature growth and development. Immatures successfully reared to teneral adults were smaller when fed BSF or BSF+CM rather than BSE+CM. Combining BSF with a powdered artificial diet (AD), i.e., BSF+AD, did not improve predator growth or development, compared to Cmac reared on BSE+CM. Cmac oviposition responses, i.e., egg clutch production, to BSF vs. BSE+CM or BSF+AD vs. BSE+CM did not differ significantly. In conclusion, BSF has the potential to be food that supports Cmac oviposition behavior. Future research is necessary to discover an ideal mixture of BSF, BSE+CM, or AD that supports Cmac growth, development, and reproduction over multiple generations.

However, direct measurement of these traits is labor\u2010intensive and time\u2010consuming. This study assessed the feasibility of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)\u2010based hyperspectral imaging and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict three agronomic traits (biomass, pod count, and yield) and two physiological traits (photosynthesis and stomatal conductance) in peanut under drought stress. Two different approaches were evaluated. The first approach employed eighty narrowband vegetation indices as input features for an ensemble model that included K\u2010nearest neighbors, support vector regression, random forest, and multi\u2010layer perceptron (MLP). The second approach utilized mean and standard deviation of canopy spectral reflectance per band. The resultant 400 features were used to train a deep learning (DL) model consisting of one\u2010dimensional convolutional layers followed by an MLP regressor.

A 36-day field mesocosm experiment tested a larger range of FGD gypsum concentrations than those previously tested in the literature to investigate its desired and potentially undesired impacts on water quality and the algal community. High FGD gypsum concentrations, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L, were found to have more undesired impacts than the 500 mg/L treatment, including an initial spike in cyanobacteria, a decrease in total zooplankton abundance, and an increase in certain trace metals in the highest treatment. Ultimately, the 500 mg/L treatment was found to have fewer undesired impacts while still resulting in significant desired effects, including those on hardness and pH, as well as moderate reductions in algal abundance.

Little to no information is available on annual population dynamics of these species in the southeastern U.S. The timing of CLRDV spread to cotton plantings is also unknown. The objective of this study was to monitor the population dynamics of eight cotton-feeding aphid species concurrent with the spread of CLRDV at three different locations in Alabama. Aphids were monitored weekly for two years with yellow pan traps, and sentinel plants were deployed weekly to monitor CLRDV spread throughout the cotton-growing season. During the two years, most CLRDV spread at all locations occurred when A. gossypii was actively dispersing in the field.

Lung lavages were performed on five animals from each treatment group on d 52.

Field experiments demonstrated that the red sticky cards baited with a pheromone blend containing hexyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate, and (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal in 4:10:7 ratio are highly effective in trapping L. lineolaris adults in early spring before the row crops are planted, and in monitoring their movement into a cotton crop.

The development and use of disease-resistant cultivars are considered the most cost-effective and sustainable approach to managing this disease. Identifying sources of resistance is essential for developing new cultivars with improved resistance to this disease. This project aimed to expand the scope of evaluation through a 2-year field study in central Florida, examining fruit from 35 cultivars from diverse origins using both artificial inoculation at the petal dehiscent stage and natural infection. Lesion size on the fruit was measured during the growing season in a field setting. Subsequently, seven cultivars were selected for further testing by inoculating detached mature fruit and measuring lesion size to confirm observed resistance and determine the correlation between resistance observed in planta in the field and on detached fruit in the laboratory. The field study revealed significant genetic differences among pomegranate cultivars in susceptibility to naturally occurring and induced anthracnose fruit rot and classified cultivars into five resistance or susceptibility classes. Five cultivars that originated from different regions of the world, including \u2018Azadi\u2019, showed consistent resistance to anthracnose fruit rot in the field. Resistance remained strong on detached mature fruit. A strong positive correlation existed between resistance levels on in-planta fruit and on detached mature fruit, suggesting a possible simple, efficient approach to screening breeding populations for anthracnose fruit rot resistance in pomegranate. These findings represent an important step toward developing new anthracnose-resistant cultivars and understanding and improving disease resistance in this increasingly important fruit crop in the world.

Merr.] is a challenge for soybean breeders but an expected goal. Many efforts have been made to develop new soybean varieties with high yield in combination with desirable protein and/or oil traits. An elite line, R05\u20101415, was reported to be high yielding, high protein, and low oil. Several significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for protein and oil were reported in this line, but many of them were unstable across environments or genetic backgrounds. Thus, a new study under multiple field environments using the Infinium BARCSoySNP6K BeadChips was conducted to detect and confirm stable genomic loci for these traits. Genetic analyses consistently detected a single major genomic locus conveying these two traits with remarkably high phenotypic variation explained (\ud835\ude19\u00b2), varying between 24.2% and 43.5%. This new genomic locus is located between 25.0 and 26.7 Mb, distant from the previously reported QTL and did not overlap with other commonly reported QTL and the recently cloned gene \ud835\ude0e\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22.20\ud835\ude0e085100.

The pleiotropic effect of this QTL could be a challenge for improving protein and oil simultaneously; however, a further study of four candidate genes with significant expressions in the seed developmental stages coupled with haplotype analysis may be able to pinpoint causative genes. The functionality and roles of these genes can be determined and characterized, which lay a solid foundation for the improvement of protein and oil content in soybeans.

After oral transmission and colonization in the gut, EHEC release Stx. Intracellular cleavage of the Stx A subunit, when followed by reduction, boosts the enzymatic activity that causes damage to targeted cells. This cleavage was assumed to be mostly mediated by furin during Stx intracellular trafficking. To investigate whether this cleavage could occur in the intestine, even prior to entering target cells, Stx2a A subunit structure (intact or cleaved) was characterized after its exposure to specific host factors present in human stool. The molecular weight of Stx2a A subunit/fragments was determined by immunoblotting after electrophoretic separation under reducing conditions. In this study, it was demonstrated that Stx2a is cleaved by certain human stool components. Trypsin and chymotrypsin-like elastase 3B (CELA3B), two serine proteases, were identified as potential candidates that can trigger the extracellular cleavage of Stx2a A subunit directly after its secretion by EHEC in the gut. Whether the observed cleavage indeed translates to natural infections and plays a role in eHUS pathogenesis has yet to be determined. If so, it seems likely that a host\u2019s protease profile could affect disease development by changing the toxin\u2019s biological features.

The BHA (blackhull awned) US weedy rice group has evolved from \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34 cultivated rice and differs from its ancestors in several important weediness traits, including flowering time, plant height and seed shattering. Prior attempts to determine the genetic basis of weediness traits in plants using linkage mapping approaches have not often considered weed origins. However, the timing of divergence between crossed parents can affect the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) relevant to the evolution of weediness. Here, we used a QTL\u2010seq approach that combines bulked segregant analysis and high\u2010throughput whole genome resequencing to map the three important weediness traits in an F\u2082 population derived from a cross between BHA weedy rice with an ancestral \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34 cultivar.

We identified multiple QTLs that overlapped with regions under selection during the evolution of weedy BHA rice and some candidate genes possibly underlying the evolution weediness traits in BHA. We showed that QTLs detected with ancestor\u2013descendant crosses are more likely to be involved in the evolution of weediness traits than those detected from crosses of more diverged taxa.

To study the unresolved pollination biology of cacao, we present a novel application of micro\u2010computed tomography (micro\u2010CT) using floral dimensions to quantify pollinator functional size limits. Methods: We generated micro\u2010CT data sets from field\u2010collected flowers and museum specimens of potential pollinators. To compare floral variation, we used 3D Slicer to place landmarks on the surface models and performed a geometric morphometric (GMM) analysis using geomorph R. We identified the petal side door (an opening between the petal hoods and filament) as the main bottleneck for pollinator access. We compared its mean dimensions with proposed pollinators to identify viable candidates. Results: We identified three levels of likelihood for putative pollinators based on the number of morphological (body) dimensions that fit through the petal side door. We also found floral reward microstructures whose presence and location were previously unclear. Discussion: Using micro\u2010CT and GMM to study the 3D pollination biology of cacao provides new evidence for predicting unknown pollinators.

Composting effectively kills pathogens, but it risks losing ammonia to volatilization or leaching during degradation of uric acid and urea. Hops bitter acids also exert antimicrobial activity against certain pathogenic and nitrogen-degrading microbes. Consequently, the present studies were conducted to test if adding bitter acid-rich hop preparations to simulated poultry litter composts may improve nitrogen retention while simultaneously improving pathogen killing. Results from an initial study, testing doses of Chinook or Galena hops preparations designed to each deliver 79 ppm hops \u03b2-acid, revealed that, after nine days simulated composting of wood chip litter, ammonia concentrations were 14% lower (p &lt; 0.05) in Chinook-treated composts than untreated composts (13.4 \u00b1 1.06 \u00b5mol/g). Conversely, urea concentrations were 55% lower (p &lt; 0.05) in Galena-treated than untreated composts (6.2 \u00b1 1.72 \u00b5mol/g). Uric acid accumulations were unaffected by hops treatments in this study but were higher (p &lt; 0.05) after three days than after zero, six, or nine days of composting. In follow-up studies, Chinook or Galena hops treatments (delivering 2042 or 6126 ppm of \u03b2-acid, respectively) for simulated composts (14 days) of wood chip litter alone or mixed 3:1 with ground Bluestem hay (Andropogon gerardii) revealed that these higher dosages had little effect on ammonia, urea, or uric acid accumulations when compared to untreated composts. Volatile fatty acid accumulations measured in these later studies were affected by the hops treatments, with butyrate accumulations being lower after 14 days in hops-treated composts than in untreated compost. In all studies, beneficial effects of Galena or Chinook hops treatments were not observed on the antimicrobial activity of the simulated composts, with composting by itself decreasing (p &lt; 0.05) counts of select microbial populations by more than 2.5 log10 colony forming units/g compost dry matter. Thus, while hops treatments had little effect on pathogen control or nitrogen retention within the composted litter, they did lessen accumulations of butyrate, which may prevent adverse effects of this fatty acid on palatability of litter fed to ruminants.

However, the role of FGF21 in regulating the energetic and reproductive physiology of beef heifers and cows has yet to be characterized. Herein, we investigated the temporal concentrations of FGF21 in female beef cattle from the prepubertal period to early lactation. Circulating concentrations of FGF21, non-esterified fatty acids, plasma urea nitrogen, glucose, and progesterone were assessed. Ultrasonography was employed to determine the onset of puberty and resumption of postpartum ovarian cyclicity as well as to measure backfat thickness. Finally, cows and calves underwent the weigh-suckle-weigh technique to estimate rate of milk production. We have revealed that FGF21 has an expansive role in the physiology of female beef cattle, including pubertal onset, adaptation to nutritional transition, rate of body weight gain, circulating markers of metabolism, and rate of milk production. In conclusion, FGF21 plays a role in physiological functions in beef cattle that can be applied to advance the understanding of basic scientific processes governing the nutritional regulation of reproductive function but also provides a novel means for beef cattle producers to select parameters of financial interest.

This paper reviews the current status of using newer technologies, explores how gene banks might make such technologies part of their routine operations, and illustrates how combining newer assisted reproductive technologies with older approaches enables populations to be reconstituted more efficiently.

This study provides comprehensive documentation of the learning process involving two conditional behavioral mechanisms and the documentation of efficient, effective, and safe animal training for virtual fence applications on nursing Brangus cows. Two hypotheses were examined: (1) animals would learn to avoid restricted zones by increasing their use of containment zones within a virtual fence polygon, and (2) animals would progressively receive fewer audio-electric cues over time and increasingly rely on auditory cues for behavioral modification. Data from GPS coordinates, behavioral metrics derived from the collar data, and cueing events were analyzed to evaluate these hypotheses. The results supported hypothesis 1, revealing that virtual fence activation significantly increased the time spent in containment zones and reduced time in restricted zones compared to when the virtual fence was deactivated. Concurrently, behavioral metrics mirrored these findings, with cows adjusting their daily travel distances, exploration area, and cumulative activity counts in response to the allocation of areas with different virtual fence configurations. Hypothesis 2 was also supported by the results, with a decrease in cueing events over time and increased reliance with animals on audio cueing to avert receiving the mild electric pulse. These outcomes underscore the rapid learning capabilities of groups of nursing cows in responding to virtual fence boundaries.

No-till systems that use cover crops to keep the soil surface covered can increase sustainability by reducing soil erosion, reducing weed pressure, and retaining soil moisture compared to bare soil cropping systems. Cover crop termination methods along with planting equipment modifications required to work in high residue planting systems are often areas of interest to farmers prior to adopting no-till systems. The objectives of this experiment are to compare the effects of two different cover crops, iron clay pea (Vigna unguiculata L.), and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), using three different termination methods (rolled/crimped, mowed, and mowed + incorporated via tillage) and two no-till transplanter configurations (with and without residue manager) on soil properties and collard (Brassica oleracea L. var. viridis) yield. Results show that biomass production for pearl millet was greater, with a three-season average of 8461 kg ha\u22121 compared to 6465 kg ha\u22121 for iron clay pea. Rolled cover crops under drier weather conditions retained more volumetric soil moisture compared to other methods for both cover crops. Increases in total soil carbon and nitrogen concentration in the top 15 cm ranged from 8 to 11% and 23 to 35%, respectively. Collards grown in an iron clay pea cover crop produced greater weight and height per plant for all growing seasons compared to those grown in pearl millet. Collard yield was affected by cover crop type as reported with iron clay peas ranging from 2881\u201313,168 kg ha\u22121 compared to lower yield for the pearl millet cover crop with a range of 1354\u20138943 kg ha\u22121. Overall, both cover crops showed the ability to improve soil health by increasing total soil carbon, but collard production was better in the iron clay pea cover crop.

To better understand the pathogenesis and health risk of this pathogen, comparative genomics and phenotypic characterization were applied to assess the pathogenicity potential of E. albertii strains isolated from wild birds in a major agricultural region in California. Shiga toxin genes stx2f were present in all avian strains. Pangenome analyses of 20 complete genomes revealed a total of 11,249 genes, of which nearly 80% were accessory genes. Both core gene-based phylogenetic and accessory gene-based relatedness analyses consistently grouped the three stx2f-positive clinical strains with the five avian strains carrying ST7971. Among the three Stx2f-converting prophage integration sites identified, ssrA was the most common one. Besides the locus of enterocyte effacement and type three secretion system, the high pathogenicity island, OI-122, and type six secretion systems were identified. Substantial strain variation in virulence gene repertoire, Shiga toxin production, and cytotoxicity were revealed. Six avian strains exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity than that of stx2f-positive E. coli, and three of them exhibited a comparable level of cytotoxicity with that of enterohemorrhagic E. coli outbreak strains, suggesting that wild birds could serve as a reservoir of E. albertii strains with great potential to cause severe diseases in humans.

Cellular immunity involves direct interactions between circulating hemocytes and invaders; it includes internalization and killing microbes (phagocytosis) and formation of bacterial-laden microaggregates which coalesce into nodules that are melanized and attached to body walls or organs. Nodulation can entail investing millions of hemocytes which must be replaced. We hypothesized that biologically costly hemocyte-based immunity is traded off for behavioral fevers in infected larvae of fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda, that were allowed to fever. We tested our hypothesis by infecting larvae with the Gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, placing them in thermal gradients (TGs) and recording their selected body temperatures. While control larvae selected about 30 \u00b0C, the experimental larvae selected up 41 \u00b0C. We found that 4 h fevers, but not 2, 6 or 24 h fevers, led to increased larval survival. Co-injections of S. marcescens with the prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis inhibitor indomethacin (INDO) blocked the fevers, which was reversed after co-injections of SM+INDO+Arachidonic acid, a precursor to PG biosynthesis, confirming that PGs mediate fever reactions. These and other experimental outcomes support our hypothesis that costly hemocyte-based immunity is traded off for behavioral fevers in infected larvae under appropriate conditions.

In this study, we proposed a comprehensive lodging area detection model performance evaluation method for multi-year and multi-phenological periods. Three evaluation indicators\u2014accuracy, potential, and stability\u2014were introduced to assess model performance from different perspectives. Additionally, a weighted method is employed to combine the results of multiple experiments. To evaluate the performance of lodging area segmentation in wheat fields, we selected three feature adaptive models (CBAM-unet, SE-unet, and Swin-transformer) along with the Unet model. The experimental results are as follows: (1) Swin-transformer achieved the highest weighted average accuracy (Acccp) of 83.53% among the four models evaluated. (2) Swin-transformer exhibited the highest upper limit of segmentation accuracy, reaching 97.98%. However, its average accuracy in the prediction experiment was 85% of the upper limit, suggesting potential for optimization. (3) CBAM-unet demonstrated the lowest overall weighted segmentation accuracy variance (35.92) compared to the other three models, indicating higher stability.

With a current over-dependence on chemical insecticides in the control of insect pests, leading to increased chemical resistance in target organisms, as well as side effects on non-target organisms, the wider environment, and human health, finding alternative solutions is paramount. The employment of entomopathogenic fungi is one such potential avenue in the pursuit of greener, more target-specific methods of insect pest control. To this end, the present study tested the chemical constituents of Metarhizium anisopliae fungi against the unicellular protozoan malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the insect pests Anopheles stephensi Listen, Spodoptera litura Fabricius, and Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, as well as the non-target bioindicator species, Eudrilus eugeniae Kinberg. Fungal crude chemical molecules caused a noticeable anti-plasmodial effect against P. falciparum, with IC50 and IC90 values of 11.53 and 7.65 \u00b5g/mL respectively. The crude chemical molecules caused significant larvicidal activity against insect pests, with LC50 and LC90 values of 49.228-71.846 \u00b5g/mL in A. stephensi, 32.542-76.510 \u00b5g/mL in S. litura, and 38.503-88.826 \u00b5g/mL in T. molitor at 24 h post treatment. Based on the results of the non-target bioassay, it was revealed that the fungal-derived crude extract exhibited no histopathological sub-lethal effects on the earthworm E. eugeniae. LC-MS analysis of M. anisopliae-derived crude metabolites revealed the presence of 10 chemical constituents. Of these chemicals, three major chemical constituents, namely, camphor (15.91 %), caprolactam (13.27%), and monobutyl phthalate (19.65%), were highlighted for potential insecticidal and anti-malarial activity.

To understand the impact of N fertilizer and pathogen species on root rot development, rhododendrons were grown with no (0 g N/pot), low (1.04 g N/pot), or high (3.12 g N/pot) rates of N and inoculated with either P. cinnamomi or P. plurivora. Noninoculated plants at low and high N rates had greater biomass, leaf greenness, and enhanced N, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, and manganese uptake compared to plants grown with no N. When either Phytophthora species was present, N application increased aboveground disease symptoms (wilting, chlorosis, reduced stomatal conductance and biomass), but had no effect on root rot severity belowground. In addition, Phytophthora cinnamomi restricted uptake of several nutrients while P. plurivora had less influence on nutrient uptake. Nurseries frequently apply high amounts of N to promote fast growth. However, our results show that this can exacerbate root rot when P. cinnamomi or P. plurivora is present.

One major quality concern is the appearance of cracks, also termed checks in the seed coat caused by mechanical damage occurring during harvest and postharvest handling. Genetic variability for seed coat checks (SCCs) has not been well characterized in kidney beans. The objectives of this study were (1) to test an existing screening method for easy assessment of seed coat mechanical damage, (2) to explore the genetic variability for mechanically induced seed coat damage in kidney bean and its relationship to seed coat thickness, (3) to characterize the relationship of SCC to end\u2010use quality, and (4) to identify potential germplasm resources for genetic improvement. A collection of dark red, light red, and white kidney beans were grown over 2\u00a0years and harvested with two threshing methods to mimic mild and severe treatments of mechanical damage. Belt threshing produced mild damage, and combine threshing produced severe damage. Seed coat thickness was not correlated with SCC of the combine\u2010threshed beans but was negatively correlated with the belt\u2010threshed beans at \ud835\ude33\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.33. Seed moisture content played an important role in SCC. Higher SCC severity scores resulted in lower canning quality appearance scores (\ud835\ude33\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.51). The SCC severity score of combine\u2010threshed seeds can be used as a selection factor in variety improvement for resilience to mechanical damage.

The present study evaluates how conventional and experimental feed mechanisms affect uniformity. The lint cleaners were used with both saw and roller gin stands. Four diverse cotton cultivars from the Far West, Southwest, and Mid-South were used in the test. Statistical analysis used a random effects modeling approach which included constructing a 95% confidence interval for each ginning treatment around the predicted mean for the fiber property of interest, and then examining which treatments overlap (for comparison). Results show that the micro-saw gin with the direct-feed lint cleaner had the best uniformity at 85.8%. Prior research has shown that roller ginning is consistently higher in uniformity than any type of saw ginning. In this study, the roller ginning treatments had uniformities of 85.3 and 85.6%, so it is encouraging that the saw gin stand with the direct-feed lint cleaner had very high uniformity. This suggests that it may be beneficial to place fiber directly onto the lint cleaning saw without changing direction. Additionally, the saw gin-coupled lint cleaner had a uniformity of 84.3% which is also a respectable level of uniformity. These results indicate that the direct-feed lint cleaner and coupled lint cleaner warrant further testing under better controlled conditions.

HTC experiments were carried out at 170 \u00b0C for 10 min. The presence of an acid increased the extent of carbonization and energy densification for both types of manure. The heating value of the hydrochar was increased by an amount ranging from 9\u201321%, with sulfuric acid having a greater impact than acetic acid. The increased fuel densification may provide for more economic use as a fuel. Both acids increased the leaching of ionic species including PO\u2084, Ca, K, Mg, and Fe. The results demonstrated conversion greater than 90% of total phosphorous to phosphate in hydrothermal conditions. HTC with sulfuric acid resulted in increased nitrogen leaching for both types of manure and resulted in the generation of ammonia. Further analysis of the aqueous products signified the formation of acetic acid, furfural, and 3-aminopyrazine 1-oxide compounds for the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal treatment. Analysis of the residual gas confirmed the presence of a trace amount of H\u2082S, NO\u2082, and SO\u2082 formation. The addition of sulfuric acid increased NO\u2082 significantly.

Despite being ubiquitous on poultry farms, there is a dearth of information on its molecular characteristics in Nigeria. This study aimed at characterizing three virulence genes (Meq, pp38, and vIL-8) of MDV1 from chickens in Ogun state, Nigeria. Blood, feather quill, and tumour samples of chickens from different commercial poultry farms in Ogun State were pooled, spotted on 107 FTA cards, and screened for MDV1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis was carried out to compare Nigerian MDV1 Meq, pp38, and vIL-8 genes sequences with the published references. Thirteen samples were MDV1-positive and the Meq, as well as pp38, and vIL-8 genes from the different samples were 100% identical. The Meq genes contained 339 amino acids (aa) with three PPPP motifs in the transactivation domain and two interruptions of the PPPP motifs due to proline-to-arginine substitutions at positions 176 and 217 resulting in a 20.88% proline composition. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Meq gene clustered with strains from Egypt and very virulent ATE2539 strain from Hungary. Mutations were observed in the pp38 protein (at positions 107 and 109) and vIL-8 protein (at positions 4 and 31).

They are significant pests, and their control heavily relies on synthetic insecticides. The extensive use of insecticides has led to public concern about their potential negative effects on human health and the well-being of wildlife and the environment. As an alternative, plant-derived natural compounds, particularly essential oils (EOs) and their main constituents, show promise as safe and environmentally friendly products for controlling fire ants. Repellants are useful in managing fire ants, and plant-derived natural repellants may serve as a safer and more environmentally friendly option. This study investigates the repellency of EO-derived compounds carvacrol, thymol, and their acetates against imported fire ant workers. The results revealed that carvacrol, a GRAS compound (Generally Recognized As Safe), was the most potent repellent against S. invicta, S. richteri, and their hybrid, with minimum repellent effective doses (MREDs) of 0.98 \u00b5g/g, 7.80 \u00b5g/g, and 0.98 \u00b5g/g, respectively. Thymol also exhibited strong repellency, with MREDs of 31.25 \u00b5g/g, 31.25 \u00b5g/g, and 7.8 \u00b5g/g, respectively. Furthermore, thyme-red essential oil, characterized by a thymol chemotype containing 48.8% thymol and 5.1% carvacrol, was found to effectively repel the hybrid ants with an MRED of 15.6 \u00b5g/g. In contrast, thyme essential oil, characterized by a linalool chemotype lacking thymol and carvacrol, did not exhibit any repellent effect, even at the highest tested dose of 125 \u00b5g/g. This study provides the first evidence of the potent repellency of carvacrol and thymol against imported fire ant workers, indicating their potential as promising repellents for fire ant control.

To manage TPB resistance, several commercially formulated pyrethroid-containing binary mixtures, in combination with neonicotinoids or avermectin are recommended for TPB control and resistance management in the mid-South USA. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and resistance risks of four formulated pyrethroid-containing binary mixtures (Endigo, Leverage, Athena, and Hero) on one susceptible and two resistant TPB populations, which were field-collected in July (Field-R1) and October (Field-R2), respectively. Based on LC50 values, both resistant TPB populations displayed variable tolerance to the four binary mixtures, with Hero showing the highest resistance and Athena the lowest. Notably, the Field-R2 exhibited 1.5\u20133-fold higher resistance compared to the Field-R1 for all four binary insecticides. Moreover, both resistant TPB populations demonstrated significantly higher resistance ratios towards Hero and Leverage compared to their corresponding individual pyrethroid, while Endigo and Athena showed similar or lower resistance. This study also utilized the calculated additive index (AI) and co-toxicity coefficient (CTC) analysis, which revealed that the two individual components in Leverage exhibited antagonist effects against the two resistant TPB populations. In contrast, the two individual components in Endigo, Hero, and Athena displayed synergistic interactions. Considering that Hero is a mixture of two pyrethroids that can enhance the development of TPB resistance, our findings suggest that Endigo and Athena are likely superior products for slowing down resistance development in TPB populations. This study provides valuable insight for selecting the most effective mixtures to achieve better TPB control through synergistic toxicity analysis, while simultaneously reducing economic and environmental risks associated with resistance development in the insect pest.

Analysis was based on the description of the study population, according to gender, age, symptoms, and position within the abattoir, as well as on outbreak epidemic curve and its probable origin. Cases of Q fever in the workers were confirmed by serology. Measurements of the association between the evaluated variables and the risk of exposure were investigated and calculated as attack rates.

Due to the tight association between virus transmission, blood feeding, and egg development, understanding midge physiology is paramount to limiting pathogen transmission. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), specifically microRNAs (miRNAs), in multiple aspects of vector physiology. These small ncRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and display differential expression during pathogen infection. Due to the lack of annotated miRNAs in the biting midge and associated expression profiles, we used small RNA-Seq and miRDeep2 analyses to determine the Culicoides miRNAs in whole females and midgut tissues in response to blood feeding. Our analyses revealed 76 miRNAs within C. sonorensis composed of 73 orthologous and three candidate novel miRNAs, as well as conserved miRNA clusters. miRNA conservation suggests an interesting evolutionary relationship between miRNA expression and hematophagy in the infraorder Culicomorpha. We also identified multiple blood meal-regulated and tissue-enriched miRNAs. Lastly, we further identified miRNAs with expression patterns potentially associated with virus infection by probing publicly available datasets. Together, our data provide a foundation for future ncRNA work to untangle the dynamics of gene regulation associated with midge physiology.

In forest margins surrounding peach, pecan, and interplanted peach\u2013pecan orchards, we monitored H. halys populations with pheromone-baited traps, mist-netted birds, and collected avian fecal samples for molecular gut content analysis. We screened 257 fecal samples from 19 bird species for the presence of H. halys DNA to determine whether birds provide the biological control of this pest. Overall, we found evidence that four birds from three species consumed H. halys, including Northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalisis), Tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Halyomorpha halys captured in traps increased over time but did not vary by orchard type. Although incidence of predation was low, this may be an underestimate as a result of our current avian fecal sampling methodology. Because birds are members of the broader food web, future studies are needed to understand avian ecosystem services, especially in terms of pest control, including H. halys and other pest species.

Beneficial microorganisms in biofloc systems produce bioactive metabolites that may deter the growth of pathogenic microbes. Biofloc technology could be useful for further integration, such as adding probiotics to manipulate the microbial community and its interactions within biofloc systems. The present study evaluated two Bacillus sp. probiotics (B. velezensis AP193 and BiOWiSH FeedBuilder Syn 3) for use in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) culture in a biofloc system. Nine independent 3785 L circular tanks were stocked with 120 juveniles (71.4 \u00b1 4.4 g). Tilapia were fed for 16 weeks and randomly assigned three diets: a commercial control diet or a commercial diet top-coated with either AP193 or BiOWiSH FeedBuilder Syn3.

This study aimed to assess the suitability of soft red winter (SRW) wheat breeding lines for local artisan bakers interested in locally sourced, strong gluten wheat for bread. Seventy-six genotyped SRW wheat breeding lines were milled into whole wheat flour and baked into small loaves. Bread aroma, flavor, and texture were evaluated by a sensory panel, and bread quality traits, including sedimentation volume, dough extensibility, and loaf volume, were measured to estimate heritability. SE-HPLC was performed on white flour, and breeding lines were characterized for different protein fraction ratios. Heritability of loaf volume was moderately high (h\u00b2 = 0.68), while heritability of sedimentation volume, a much easier trait to measure, was slightly lower (h\u00b2= 0.55). Certain protein fraction ratios strongly related to loaf volume had high heritability (h\u00b2 = 0.7). Even though only a moderate heritability estimate of dough extensibility was found in our study, high positive correlations were found between this parameter and sedimentation volume (r = 0.6) and loaf volume (r = 0.53). This low-input and highly repeatable parameter could be useful to estimate dough functionality characteristics. Flavor and texture heritability estimates ranged from 0.16 to 0.37, and the heritability estimate of aroma was not significantly different from zero. However, the sensorial characteristics were significantly correlated with each other, suggesting that we might be able to select indirectly for aroma by selecting for flavor or texture characteristics. From a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified six SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with loaf volume that could be useful in breeding for this trait. Producing high-quality strong gluten flour in our high rainfall environment is a challenge, but it provides local growers and end users with a value-added opportunity.

Combining TFMSA technology with genomic selection could efficiently evaluate sorghum B-lines in hybrid combination to maximize the rates of genetic gain of the crop. This study used two recombinant inbred B-line populations, consisting of a total of 217 lines which were testcrossed to two R-lines to produce 434 hybrids. Population based genomic prediction models were assessed across locations using three different cross-validation schemes (CV), each with a 70% training and 30% validation sets. The validation schemes were, CV1: hybrids chosen randomly for validation; CV2: B-lines were randomly chosen, and each chosen B-line had one of the two corresponding testcross hybrids randomly chosen for the validation; and CV3: B-lines were randomly chosen, and each chosen B-line had both of the two corresponding testcross hybrids chosen for the validation. CV1 and CV2 presented the highest prediction accuracies; nonetheless, the prediction accuracies of the CV schemes were not statistically different in many environments. We determined that combining the B-line populations could improve prediction accuracies and the genomic prediction models were able to effectively rank the bottom 70% of hybrids even when genomic prediction accuracies themselves were low.

There is an unmet opportunity to test science\u2010based approaches to seed mix design and application, based not only on diversity or local provenance, but on the unique recruitment strategies of species. We lay out a framework that uses a quantitative representation of species&#039; recruitment niches to match them to targeted goals (e.g. drought or invasion resistance) and methods (e.g. precision tools and technologies) in SBR. We first describe how to quantify the recruitment niche with seed and seedling traits tied to observed recruitment responses to environmental factors. We then show how a quantified recruitment niche framework can serve as the foundation to address three major restoration challenges: (1) designing forward\u2010looking seed mixes that increase resilience to future climate and disturbance, (2) accounting for natural recovery in SBR planning, and (3) applying precision seeding practices to maximize restoration success. Finally, we demonstrate these ideas with existing data and discuss key challenges to adoption in SBR practice. While the ideas in this framework are based in ecological theory, they will require substantial testing and refinement by scientists engaged in SBR efforts. If this framework is integrated into research agendas, we believe it has the potential to unify and advance diverse elements of seed\u2010based restoration ecology and improve restoration outcomes.

Five experiments were performed over ten production years with fruit from two environmentally different orchard locations in a humid subtropical climate at 990 m (warmer) and 1415 m above sea level. Fruit were harvested at two maturity stages (early and advanced), treated or not treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and stored at 0.5 \u00b0C or 2\u00b0C in a controlled atmosphere (CA, 1.5 kPa O\u2082 and 2.5 kPa CO\u2082), for eight months plus seven days shelf life. In one experiment, fruit were stored in CA with CO\u2082 concentrations of 1.5 or 3 kPa. The relationship between fruit mineral composition and physiological disorders was assessed in one production year. Flesh browning (FB) was the predominant disorder, followed by decay, cracking, and lenticel breakdown-wet (LB-wet). The average incidence of lenticel breakdown-dry (LB-dry), leather blotch and bitter pit were low and variable across production years. The FB index (incidence weighted by severity) was lowest in fruit produced at the colder orchard location, early harvest, treatment with 1-MCP, and storage at 2\u00b0C. These factors also influenced fruit softening after storage. The major source of variance of the FB index in order of decreasing contribution were harvest maturity, production year, orchard location, 1-MCP and storage temperature. Production year variability of FB index correlated positively with early summer rain and negatively with early spring temperature. A weak positive correlation was also found between FB index and fruit K+Mg/Ca ratio. Higher CA CO\u2082 concentration increased FB in fruit stored at 0.5\u00b0C but not at 2\u00b0C. The same factors affected decay, cracking and LB-wet disorder similarly as for FB, except that decay and cracking were not consistently affected by storage temperature, and decay and LB-wet were not impacted by 1-MCP. Storage temperature had the most influence on the variance of LB-wet. LB-dry was highest in late harvest fruit and, in the production year with the highest incidence, in fruit stored at 0.5 \u00b0C. Leather blotch was highest in early harvest fruit and in fruit stored at 0.5 \u00b0C. 1-MCP treatment did not affect disorders other than FB and cracking. These results suggest that interactions among harvest and postharvest factors influence the development of \u2018Gala\u2019 FB and other disorders and indicate a possible relationship of chilling in FB development. The information may be useful for implementing practical strategies to reduce the development of these postharvest disorders in \u2018Gala\u2019 apple fruit.", "publication_date": "2023-10-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 204, "issue": "", "first_page": 112439, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20401248%20-%20Published%20Article.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 438251, "log_number": 401248, "created": 1691585558, "changed": 1710012146}, {"submission_node_id": 670, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Nevertheless, the addition of rhIGF1 with the MIS increased the proportion of oocytes completing GVBD compared with MIS alone, although this potentiation was small and varied greatly among clutches of follicles from fish with oocytes at different stages of germinal vesicle migration. Collectively, these observations suggest IGFs may have synergistic actions with the MIS but cannot induce resumption of meiosis directly at the oocyte and are not potent inducers of OMC in rainbow trout.

This research details the Discontinued Food Codes between FNDDS 2017\u20132018 and FNDDS 2019\u20132020, the fifth discontinued codes resource release. More than 1800 discontinued codes are included, which is comparable to the FNDDS 2017\u20132018 and double the FNDDS 2015\u20132016 releases. More than 75 % of these codes are consolidated into similar FNDDS food codes. This highlights the continued focus on incorporating generic food codes in FNDDS that reflect the foods Americans consume. A few highly reported food codes representing more than one product were expanded. This resource is beneficial to those who use FNDDS and researchers who conduct trend analysis using WWEIA, NHANES.

It is used in various processed forms and has become the focus of research and innovation in recent years. Bioprocessing techniques, such as fermentation, have been utilized to create new avenues for its application in food and functional products. The fermentation of cassava can enhance its nutritional value, improve its shelf life, and increase its digestibility. However, the effect of salt-mediated fermentation on microbial diversity and potential benefits has not been widely reported. In this study, the effect of six levels of salt (NaCl), ranging from 0 to 25% after 50 days of spontaneous cassava fermentation at 25\u201330 \u00b0C, was investigated. A total of 30 bacterial isolates were selected for molecular characterization. A proprietary pool of universal 16S rRNA primers and species-specific primers were used to amplify a wide variety of species in clonal samples. The bacteria observed include Lactiplantibacillus, Limosilactobacillus, and Weissella. The population of Lactiplantibacillus in the cassava microflora increased with and without salt treatment, while Weissella, a new genus, was detected in 20 and 25% of salt-treated samples. Lactiplantibacillus and Weissella accounted for 32 and 68% and 60 and 40% of the bacterial populations detected at 20 and 25% salt treatment, respectively. A total of 17 strains and sequences were identified from the 30 isolates screened. Sequencing results classified the 30 isolates into four groups, of which 76.67% were Limosilactobacillus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 17 strains were divided into three clusters. These results show that high salt-mediated fermentation of cassava can trigger a shift in dominance in the bacterial community, changing the diversity of the microbial community.

The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a 24-hour laboratory bioassay in determining maximum dose insecticide efficacy in the field. Ten insecticides were evaluated using leaf-dip bioassays, and their effectiveness was tested across eight cucurbit field experiments in Georgia, USA, during the 2021 and 2022 field seasons. The maximum dose, defined as the highest labeled rate of an insecticide diluted in the equivalent of 935 L ha\u22121 of water, was used for all bioassays. Adult survival observed in the bioassay was compared to adult field count-based survival 24 h after treatment. A low concentration (1/10 rate) was used for imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, pyriproxyfen, and cyantraniliprole to assess insecticide tolerance in the whitefly population. Overall, significant positive correlation between laboratory bioassay and field efficacy was reported, explaining 50\u201391% of the observed variation. The addition of the low dosage was helpful, indicating that no rate response was consistent with susceptibility to the tested insecticide, while a rate response was associated with a loss of susceptibility between 2021 and 2022.

In this study, we identified and characterized the capa and pyrokinin genes from the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. The capa gene transcribes three splice variants, capa-a, -b, and -c, encoding two CAPA-PVK peptides (EVQGLFPFPRVamide and QGLIPFPRVamide) and two PK2 peptides (ASWMPSSSPRLamide and DSASFTPRLamide). The pyrokinin gene expects to translate one PK1 (DLVTQVLQPGQTGMWFGPRLamide) and two PK2 peptides (SEGNLVNFTPRLamide and ESGEQPEDLEGSMGGAATSRQLRTDSEPTWGFSPRLamide). The second peptide of PK2 corresponds to the insect PBAN domain and one of the most extended PBAN orthologs in inects. Multiple potential endoproteolytic cleavage sites were presented in the three PK prepropeptides from the pk gene, creating an ambiguity to predict mature peptides. We used GPCRs that are corresponding receptors for CAPA, PK1 and PK2 peptides to solve the difficulty. The three different types of GPCRs were functionally expressed in Sf9 cells and tested to measure binding affinities of the thrips peptides. The binding activities among the receptors and peptides showed that each subfamily peptides exclusively bind to their corresponding receptors, but no or little responses to different family receptors. The binding information was significant for determining the sequences of the CAPA and PK peptides. Our biological method using specific GPCR in this study would be a valuable tool to determine prepropeptides particularly with multiple and ambiguous cleavage sites. Not surprisingly, both capa and pk genes were strongly expressed in the head and thorax, but weakly or barely detected in the abdomen tissues. The two genes were clearly expressed during the immature and adult stages: not the capa expression in the embryo. The whole-mounting immunocytochemistry revealed that the neurons contained PRXamide-like peptides through the head, thorax, and abdomen. Four to six neurosecretory cells were found in the head. Three and seven pairs of immunostained cells were detected in the thorax and abdomen, respectively. It\u2019s unusual that the thrips PK2-2 corresponding to the insect PBAN domains, is the longest case found so far, and that more immunoreactive neurosecretory cell pairs were found in the abdomen, suggesting the PRXamide profiles of Thysanoptera are different from the other insect groups.", "publication_date": "2023-06-02", "date_other": "", "volume": 31, "issue": "", "first_page": 1, "last_page": 2, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20394219%20-%20Choi%20394219%20Manuscript.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 439374, "log_number": 394219, "created": 1688585264, "changed": 1710011827}, {"submission_node_id": 364, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Here, we comparatively evaluated the demographic parameters of four important eupelmid egg parasitoids (Anastatus fulloi, A. japonicus, Mesocomys albitarsis and M. trabalae) reared on the factitious host eggs of the Chinese oak silkworm Antheraea pernyi, using age-stage two-sex life tables, their population projections as well as egg maturation patterns. RESULTS Both the age-specific net reproductive rate (lxmx) and reproductive value (vxj) increased initially and then gradually decreased with increasing age in all four parasitoid species. Overall, the two Mesocomys species had higher survival rates at stable age-stage distribution, peak reproductive values, and intrinsic rates of increase than the two Anastatus species. Mesocomys albitarsis had the longest longevity, whereas A. japonicus had the longest oviposition days and mean generation time. The two Mesocomys species are thus projected to have faster population increase than the two Anastatus species. Adult females of all four parasitoid species emerged with only a few mature eggs (&lt;\u20096 eggs) and most of their eggs were matured post-emergence (strict synovigeny). The estimated 90% of lifetime complement of reproduction (offspring) and realized days were 374 and 32 for A. japonicus, 337 and 22 for M. trabalae, 330 and 19 for M. albitarsis and 147 and 28 for A. fulloi. CONCLUSION Our results indicated that the two Mesocomys species have higher control capacity than the two Anastatus species. Provision of adult food for these strictly synovigenic parasitoids would be essential to prolong their lifespan and continuously produce eggs for parasitizing their hosts for mass rearing or augmentative biological control programs. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.", "publication_date": "2023-05-13", "date_other": "", "volume": "", "issue": "", "first_page": "", "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20402983%20-%202023%20Mu%20et%20al.%20Comparative%20demographics.pdf", "manuscript_version": "accepted_manuscript", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 438519, "log_number": 402983, "created": 1685656616, "changed": 1710011772}, {"submission_node_id": 506, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

planted in the United States to control lepidopteran pests. The sustainability of these Bt crops is threatened because the corn earworm/bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), is evolving a resistance to these toxins. Using Bt sweet corn as a sentinel plant to monitor the evolution of resistance, collaborators established 146 trials in twenty-five states and five Canadian provinces during 2020\u20132022. The study evaluated overall changes in the phenotypic frequency of resistance (the ratio of larval densities in Bt ears relative to densities in non-Bt ears) in H. zea populations and the range of resistance allele frequencies for Cry1Ab and Vip3Aa. The results revealed a widespread resistance to Cry1Ab, Cry2Ab2, and Cry1A.105 Cry toxins, with higher numbers of larvae surviving in Bt ears than in non-Bt ears at many trial locations. Depending on assumptions about the inheritance of resistance, allele frequencies for Cry1Ab ranged from 0.465 (dominant resistance) to 0.995 (recessive resistance). Although Vip3Aa provided high control efficacy against H. zea, the results show a notable increase in ear damage and a number of surviving older larvae, particularly at southern locations. Assuming recessive resistance, the estimated resistance allele frequencies for Vip3Aa ranged from 0.115 in the Gulf states to 0.032 at more northern locations.

Alternatively, expensive in vivo studies in animals have been conducted. Therefore, our objective was to develop a comprehensive in vitro organ culture system of the RAJ (RAJ-IVOC) that accurately represents all cell types present in the RAJ. This system would enable studies that yield results similar to those observed in vivo. Pieces of RAJ tissue, obtained from unrelated cattle necropsies, were assembled and subjected to various tests in order to determine the optimal conditions for assaying bacterial adherence in a viable IVOC. O157 strain EDL933 and E. coli K12 with known adherence differences were used to standardize the RAJ-IVOC adherence assay. Tissue integrity was assessed using cell viability, structural cell markers, and histopathology, while the adherence of bacteria was evaluated via microscopy and culture methods. DNA fingerprinting verified the recovered bacteria against the inoculum. When the RAJ-IVOC was assembled in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium, maintained at a temperature of 39 \u00b0C with 5% CO\u2082 and gentle shaking for a duration of 3\u20134 h, it successfully preserved tissue integrity and reproduced the expected adherence phenotype of the bacteria being tested. The RAJ-IVOC model system provides a convenient method to pre-screen multiple bacteria-RAJ interactions prior to in vivo experiments, thereby reducing animal usage.

Pineapple juice without turmeric was the control. The L*, a*, b*, titratable acidity (TA), total antioxidant capacity, and %DPPH scavenging values, as well as the concentrations of the phenolic compounds curcumin and demethoxycurcumin, were significantly increased with increasing turmeric concentration. Thirty volatile compounds were detected in the mixed juice samples with turmeric. Most of the turmeric-specific compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and turmerones, were detected in the TFP juice samples. While the antioxidant activity of the juice samples increased with increasing turmeric concentration, the pineapple juice fortified with 10% turmeric (10%T) had the best overall quality as determined by panelists. Greater concentrations of turmeric were associated with decreased palatability due to reduced mouthfeel and sweetness and increased aftertaste and sourness. These results suggest that the 10%T juice could be developed into a commercial functional beverage with increased overall flavor and nutritional quality.

Natural variation in quality parameters such as fineness, length, and strength present a challenge for cotton fiber conversion to yarns and in weaving and knitting for conventional textiles. The grading process for cotton fibers addresses this issue by allowing converters to select fibers suitable for specific woven textile applications. However, there has been little attempt to correlate cotton fiber quality traits with nonwoven textiles performance. This study examined the relationship of cotton fiber quality and fluid handling and moisture management performance properties of nonwoven textiles for personal hygiene and disposable applications. This includes potential end-use in diapers and incontinence products as well as disposable textiles for use in clinical settings. Ten recombinant inbred lines of cotton with a broad distribution of fiber quality traits were selected from a multiparent advanced generation intercross population. Fibers were harvested, converted into nonwoven textiles, and subjected to a series of standardized testing protocols. The results indicated that inferior quality coarse cotton fibers subjected to discount market pricing can be selectively utilized for nonwoven applications that benefit from improved moisture management and fluid handling performance.

The cost is the combined outcome of feed cost and feed management. As feeding technology evolves, specifically the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) feeding systems, it is vital to reevaluate the optimal protein levels in diets for the best production outcomes. The use of acoustic monitoring adds another level of complexity to how shrimp respond to feed because it has the potential to automatically adjust feed offerings based on protein because of the shrimp\u2019s response. In this research, four diets with various protein levels (40, 35, 30, and 25%) were fed to shrimp which were stocked (0.045 g, 25 shrimp/m\u00b2) into 16 ponds (0.1 ha) and cultured for an 85-day production cycle. Shrimp were fed using the AQ1 passive acoustic monitoring system. Final individual weights were significantly smaller for shrimp fed the 25% diet (31.22 g) compared to all other diets. The total biomass of all ponds ranged from 7,037- 7,878 kg/ha for shrimp offered the 25%- 40% diets, respectively. . Other than final weight, analysis of this and all other production data showed no differences between treatments (p&gt;0.05). Whole-body analysis revealed significant differences in fat (p=0.0002), copper (p=0.018), and apparent net protein retention (p=0.0025). Analysis of economic values indicated a statistically significant difference between treatments for feed cost (p=0.020). The significantly lower individual weights from shrimp fed the 25% diet and the notably lower total biomass resulted in a subsequent difference in class size distribution. This ultimately led to a difference in the market value of the shrimp ranging from $60,383 to $71,247. Although, the 40% protein diet was significantly higher in cost it showed no differences in production or economic outcomes compared to the other diets.

In the U.S., Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) is the pathogen that is associated with HLB, an unculturable, phloem-limited bacteria, vectored by the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri). There is no known cure nor treatment to effectively control HLB, and current control methods are primarily based on the use of insecticides and antibiotics, where effectiveness is limited and may have negative impacts on beneficial and non-target organisms. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective and sustainable treatment options to reduce or eliminate CLas from infected trees. In the present study, we screened citrus-derived endophytes, their cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS), and crude plant extracts for antimicrobial activity against two culturable surrogates of CLas, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Liberibacter crescens. Candidates considered high-potential antimicrobial agents were assessed directly against CLas in vitro, using a propidium monoazide\u2013based assay. As compared to the negative controls, statistically significant reductions of viable CLas cells were observed for each of the five bacterial CFCS. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that each of the five bacterial isolates were most closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a species dominating the market of biological control products. As such, the aboveground endosphere of asymptomatic survivor citrus trees, grown in an organic orchard, were found to host bacterial endophytes capable of effectively disrupting CLas cell membranes. These results concur with the theory that native members of the citrus microbiome play a role in the development of HLB. Here, we identify five strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens demonstrating notable potential to be used as sources of novel antimicrobials for the sustainable management of HLB.

The in vitro method permits a spatially-resolved view of metabolic transformations under human physiological conditions.

N status and making in-season N fertilization decisions. However, PNC varies based on the development stage. Therefore, a relationship between biomass and N concentration is needed (i.e., critical N dilution curve; CNDC) to better understand when plants are N deficient. A few CNDCs have been developed and used for plant N status diagnoses but have not been tested in the US Midwest. The objective of this study was to evaluate under highly diverse soil and weather conditions in the US Midwest the performance of CNDCs developed in France and China for assessing maize N status. Maize N rate response trials were conducted across eight US Midwest states over three years. This analysis utilized plant and soil measurements at V9 and VT development stages and final grain yield. Results showed that the French CNDC (y = 34.0x\u22120.37, where y is critical PNC, and x is aboveground biomass) was better with a 91% N status classification accuracy compared to only 62% with the Chinese CNDC (y = 36.5x\u22120.48). The N nutrition index (NNI), which is the quotient of the measured PNC and the calculated critical N concentration (Nc) based on the French CNDC was significantly related to soil nitrate-N content (R\u00b2 = 0.38\u20130.56). Relative grain yield on average reached a plateau at NNI values of 1.36 at V9 and 1.21 at VT but for individual sites ranging from 0.80 to 1.41 at V9 and from 0.62 to 1.75 at VT. The NNI threshold values or ranges optimal for crop biomass production may not be optimal for grain yield production. It is concluded that the CNDC developed in France is suitable as a general diagnostic tool for assessing maize N status in US Midwest. However, the threshold values of NNI for diagnosing maize N status and guiding N applications vary significantly across the region, making it challenging to guide specific on-farm N management. More studies are needed to determine how to effectively use CNDC to make in-season N recommendations in the US Midwest.

Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid sequencing (Y2H-Seq) identified several potential apoptotic regulatory interacting proteins, including the MDM2-like ubiquitination regulatory protein, which may represent an apoptosis factor unique to Bmp53 and which differs from that in other Lepidoptera. These results provide a theoretical basis for analyzing the various biological processes regulated by Bmp53 interaction groups and thus provide insight into the regulation of apoptosis in silkworms. The global interaction set identified in this study also provides a basic framework for future studies on apoptosis-dependent pupation in Lepidoptera.

Field outcomes with Bt cotton and pink bollworm during the past quarter century differ markedly among the world\u2019s top three cotton-producing countries: practical resistance in India, sustained susceptibility in China, and eradication of this invasive lepidopteran pest from the United States achieved with Bt cotton and other tactics. We compared the molecular genetic basis of pink bollworm resistance between lab-selected strains from the U.S. and China and field-selected populations from India for two Bt proteins (Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab) produced in widely adopted Bt cotton. Both lab- and field-selected resistance are associated with mutations affecting the cadherin protein PgCad1 for Cry1Ac and the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein PgABCA2 for Cry2Ab. The results imply lab selection is useful for identifying genes important in field-evolved resistance to Bt crops, but not necessarily the specific mutations in those genes.

This species was introduced to the island of Kaua\u2018i, Hawai\u2018i, USA, in the 1960s. The rapidly increasing population has caused substantial economic losses in the agricultural and tourism industries. We evaluated the efficacy of a roost culling program conducted by an independent contractor from March 2020 to March 2021. We estimated island-wide minimum abundance was 10,512 parakeets in January 2020 and 7,372 in April 2021. Over 30 nights of culling at four roost sites, approximately 6,030 parakeets were removed via air rifles with 4,415 (73%) confirmed via carcasses retrieval. An estimated average of 45 parakeets were removed per hour of shooter effort. The proportion of adult females removed in 2020 was 1.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009greater when culled outside of the estimated nesting season. Of the four roosts where culling occurred, the parakeets fully abandoned three and partially abandoned one site. Of the three fully abandoned roosts, an estimated average of 29.6% of birds were culled prior to roost abandonment. The roost culling effort was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tourist numbers and foot traffic were greatly reduced. It is unknown how public perception of roost culling in public areas may impact future efforts. Findings suggest roost culling can be utilized for management of nonnative rose-ringed parakeet populations when roost size is small enough and staff size large enough to cull entire roosts in no greater than two consecutive nights (e.g., if two shooters are available for three hours per night, roost culling should only be attempted on a roost with\u2009\u2264\u2009540 rose-ringed parakeets).

Different avenues of investigation into primary drivers of wind erosion and dust have yielded mixed results depending on the spatial and temporal sensitivity of the evidence.  We monitored passive aeolian sediment traps from 2017 to 2020 across eighty-one sites near Moab UT to understand patterns of sediment flux. At measurement sites we collated climate, soil, topography and vegetation spatial layers to better understand the context of wind erosion and then combine these data with field observations of land use in models to characterize the influence of cattle grazing, oil and gas well pads, and vehicle/heavy equipment disturbance that potentially drive both exposure of bare soil and increases in erodible sediment supply that increase vulnerability to erosion. Disturbed areas with low soil calcium carbonate content yielded high sediment transport in dry years, but notably areas with little disturbance and low bare soil exposure had much less activity. Cattle grazing had the largest land use association with erosional activity with analyses suggesting that both herbivory and trampling from cattle could be drivers. The amount and distribution of bare soil exposure from new sub-annual fractional cover remote sensing products proved very helpful in mapping erosion, and new predictive maps informed by field data are presented to help depict spatial patterns of wind erosion activity.

Biosynthesis of storage reserves occurs in multiple organelles that exchange central intermediates including two essential metabolites, malate, and pyruvate that are linked by malic enzyme. Malic enzyme can be active in multiple subcellular compartments, partitioning carbon and reducing equivalents for anabolic and catabolic requirements. Prior studies based on isotopic labeling and steady\u2010state metabolic flux analyses indicated malic enzyme provides carbon for fatty acid biosynthesis in plants, though genetic evidence confirming this role is lacking. We hypothesized that increasing malic enzyme flux would alter carbon partitioning and result in increased lipid levels in soybeans. Homozygous transgenic soybean plants expressing Arabidopsis malic enzyme alleles, targeting the translational products to plastid or outside the plastid during seed development, were verified by transcript and enzyme activity analyses, organelle proteomics, and transient expression assays. Protein, oil, central metabolites, cofactors, and acyl\u2010acyl carrier protein (ACPs) levels were quantified overdevelopment. Amino and fatty acid levels were altered resulting in an increase in lipids by 0.5\u20132% of seed biomass (i.e. 2\u20139% change in oil).

The causal agent, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), is a bacterium transmitted by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), and by grafting. As a last resort to control citrus greening, growers were approved to spray antibiotics: streptomycin (STR) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in commercial citrus groves in Florida. This study analyzed the impact of antibiotic sprays on citrus trees by quantifying CLas titer and bacterial colony count from leaf, root+rhizosphere, and soil samples collected in three citrus groves. Two used antibiotic spray treatment (two conventional groves) and one used no antibiotic treatment (one organic grove). Samples were plated onto TSA medium containing either, STR (1 mg/mL), OTC (1 mg/mL) or no antibiotic (control) and colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of sample were estimated. For leaf samples in addition to the plating, DNA was extracted from leaves and used to quantify CLas titer. Among leaf samples, there were no significant differences in CFU or CLas titer based on grove. For soil samples, we found a larger number of resistant CFU in the organic grove.

We conducted a meta-analysis using a combined dataset of 1105 experiments for high daytime temperature (HDT) and 841 experiments for high nighttime temperatures (HNT) from peer-reviewed published articles to investigate the effects of high daytime temperature (HDT) and high nighttime temperatures (HNT) on rice yield components (such as panicle number, spikelet number per panicle, percent fertility, grain weight) and quality traits (such as milling yield, chalkiness, amylose and protein contents). We constructed dose-response curves and studied phenotypic plasticity of rice traits in response to HDT and HNT. The results suggest that HNT had a more detrimental impact on rice yield and quality when compared with HDT. The optimum daytime and nighttime temperatures for best rice yield were approximately 28\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C, respectively. Grain yield showed a decline by 7% and 6% for each 1\u00b0C increase in HNT and HDT, respectively, when exceeded the optimum temperatures. The seed set rate (percent fertility) was the most sensitive trait to HDT and HNT and accounted for most of the yield losses. Both the HDT and HNT affected grain quality by increasing chalkiness and decreasing head rice percentage, which may affect rice marketability of the rice produced. Additionally, HNT was found to significantly impact nutritional quality (e.g., protein content). The dose-response curve analyses suggest that while the highest ambient temperature reading during day and night could be important, total heat degree hours (HDH) during daytime and nighttime seems to be critical for deciding tolerance or susceptibility of rice germplasm. Further, the findings fill current knowledge gaps on estimations of rice yield losses and possible economic consequences under high temperatures and suggest that rice quality impacts should also be considered for selection and breeding of high-temperature tolerant rice varieties in responses to HDT and HNT.", "publication_date": "2023-11-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 898, "issue": "", "first_page": 165256, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20403052%20-%20Rohila%20Science%20of%20the%20Total%20Environment.pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 434318, "log_number": 403052, "created": 1691585639, "changed": 1709925084}, {"submission_node_id": 631, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Pistil abortion takes place in the tassel florets, and stamen arrest is affected in ear florets to give rise to the monoecious nature of maize. Gibberellin (GA) deficiency results in increased tillering, a dwarfed plant syndrome, and the retention of anthers in the ear florets of maize. The silkless1 mutant results in suppression of silks in the ear. We demonstrate in this study that jasmonic acid (JA) and GA act independently and show additive phenotypes resulting in androecious dwarf1;silkless1 double mutant plants. The persistence of pistils in the tassel can be induced by multiple mechanisms, including JA deficiency, GA excess, genetic control of floral determinacy, and organ identity. The silkless1 mutant can suppress both silks in the ear and the silks in the tassel of JA-deficient and AP2 transcription factor tasselseed mutants. We previously demonstrated that GA production was required for brassinosteroid (BR) deficiency to affect persistence of pistils in the tassel. We find that BR deficiency affects pistil persistence by an independent mechanism from the silkless1 mutant and JA pathway. The silkless1 mutant did not prevent the formation of pistils in the tassel by nana plant2 in double mutants. In addition, we demonstrate that there is more to the silkless1 mutant than just a suppression of pistil growth. We document novel phenotypes of silkless1 mutants including weakly penetrant ear fasciation and anther persistence in the ear florets.

Notably, we found a significant lag time of \u223c5 days between changes in soil moisture and canopy greenness under large/few events, while there was no lag under small/many events. This time lag was found to be driven by perennial grass greenness and its sensitivity to the relatively deep soil water infiltration observed with large/few rainfall events.

We took advantage of the natural diversity of Arabidopsis thaliana kinases to probe the ZAR1-kinase interaction interface and found that ZAR1 can interact with most ZRKs, except ZRK7. We found evidence of alternative splicing of ZRK7, resulting in a protein that can interact with ZAR1. Despite high sequence conservation of ZAR1, interspecific ZAR1-ZRK pairings resulted in auto-activation of cell death. We showed that ZAR1 interacts with a greater diversity of kinases than previously thought, while still possessing the capacity for specificity in kinase interactions. Finally, using ZAR1-ZRK interaction data, we rationally increased ZRK10 interaction strength with ZAR1, demonstrating the feasibility of rational design of a ZAR1-interacting kinase. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of the rules governing the ZAR1 pathogen recognition system, with promising future directions for expanding ZAR1 immunodiversity.", "publication_date": "2023-05-09", "date_other": "", "volume": 46, "issue": 7, "first_page": 2238, "last_page": 2254, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20399055%20-%20ARS-115%20Log%20%23399055%20%28Lewis%29%20Manuscript%20Plant%20Cell%20Environment%20-%202023%20-%20Diplock%20-%20Utilising%20natural%20diversity%20of%20kinases%20to%20rationally%20engineer%20interactions%20with.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 434465, "log_number": 399055, "created": 1685656571, "changed": 1709924536}, {"submission_node_id": 720, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

Therefore, the development of new preventative measures against MDR Salmonella is highly important. Bacterial antibiotic resistance is commonly mediated by efflux pumps. In this study, two compounds that block efflux pump activity, 1-(1-Naphthylmethyl)-Piperazine (NMP) and Phenylalanine-arginine \u03b2-naphthylamide (Pa\u03b2N), were tested with the antibiotic tetracycline to determine if a synergistic reduction in resistance could be achieved in tetracycline-resistant Salmonella. The efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) reduced Salmonella resistance to tetracycline by 16 to 32-fold in several tetracycline resistant isolates. For example, the tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for MDR Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5],12:i:- USDA15WA-1 (SX 238) was 256 \u03bcg/mL. However, in the presence of NMP (250 \u03bcg/mL), the MIC dropped to 8 \u03bcg/mL which is below the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoint for tetracycline resistance in Salmonella (\u226516 \u03bcg/mL). Confocal and transmission electron microscopy revealed NMP-mediated damage to Salmonella membranes at a higher concentration (1000 \u03bcg/mL), implying that the EPI disrupts membrane morphology which can lead to cell death; however, this effect was dependent on NMP concentration, as NMP blocked efflux activity with less of a membrane-disrupting effect at a lower concentration (250 \u03bcg/mL). These findings suggest that the use of EPIs can reduce the MIC of tetracycline and restore the effectiveness of the antibiotic against tetracycline-resistant Salmonella.", "publication_date": "2023-08-06", "date_other": "", "volume": 668, "issue": "", "first_page": 49, "last_page": 54, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20403698%20-%20Published%20article%20403698%204.1.2023.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 440948, "log_number": 403698, "created": 1694174120, "changed": 1709924505}, {"submission_node_id": 549, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

These anti-3-1E mAbs specifically recognized E. tenella sporozoites and a higher level of 3-1E was detected in the lysate of sporozoites than in sporocysts. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using 2 mAbs (#318 and #320) showed specific staining around the membrane of E. tenella sporozoites. In order to measure the changes in the 3-1E level during in coccidiosis, serum, feces, jejunal, and cecal contents were individually collected daily for 7-days postinfection (dpi) with E. maxima and E. tenella. The new ELISA was sensitive and specific for 3-1E detection in all samples collected daily from E. maxima- and E. tenella-infected chickens for a week, and the detection sensitivity ranges were 2 to 5 ng/mL and 1 to 5 ng/mL in serum, 4 to 25 ng/mL and 4 to 30 ng/mL in feces, 1 to 3 ng/mL and 1 to 10 ng/mL in cecal contents, and 3 to 65 ng/mL and 4 to 22 ng/mL in jejunal contents. Following coccidiosis, the overall 3-1E levels started to increase from 4 dpi, and the highest production was shown on 5 dpi. Among the samples collected from Eimeria-infected chickens, the highest detection level was found in the jejunal contents of E. maxima-infected chickens. Furthermore, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in serum was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased from 3 dpi and peaked on 5 dpi post E. maxima infection. Post E. tenella infection, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in serum gradually (P &lt; 0.05) increased from 2 to 5 dpi and plateaued at 7 dpi. The level of TNF-\u03b1 in serum was rapidly (P &lt; 0.05) increased from 4 dpi and those levels were kept until 7 dpi post both Eimeria infections (E. maxima and E. tenella). More importantly, the daily changes in the 3-1E levels in different samples from E. maxima- and E. tenella-infected chickens were effectively monitored with this new antigen-capture ELISA.

But choosing an appropriate model or method remains challenging because we need a model to have both good predictive power in projecting yields changes and good explanatory power in capturing direct linkages between yield responses and climate variables so that we can make adaptations according to these responses. Here, we proposed a Bayesian model (BM) framework based on Bayesian learning for characterizing yield responses to climate variables. This framework can capture nonlinear relationships between crop yield and climate variables and also has high interpretability. We compared the predictive and explanatory power of BM with two machine learning models which are usually good at prediction but with low interpretability and an inherently interpretable regression-based model via two experiments. In the first experiment with synthetic data, our results show that BM outperforms the two machine learning methods--Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF)--in unveiling relationships between explanatory and response variables (i.e., interpretability). In the second experiment of decomposing the complex climate and crop yield relationships with historical maize yield and climate records, BM is comparable with NN and RF in prediction abilities, and all of the three models perform better than a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model. Overall, the proposed BM framework achieves a balance between predictive power and explanatory power, and could be a competitive alternative to both conventional regression methods and machine learning models in characterizing climate impacts on crop yield and informing adaptation strategies.", "publication_date": "2023-06-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 336, "issue": "", "first_page": 109458, "last_page": "", "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20395798%20-%20Crop%20yield%20prediction%20via%20explainable%20A...pdf", "manuscript_version": "publisher_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": 440473, "log_number": 395798, "created": 1685656564, "changed": 1709924348}, {"submission_node_id": 500, "submitter_email": "kristina.adams@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "KRISTINA M.

The D8-Mpl and D9-1 alleles disrupt GA signaling, resulting in short plants and normal tassel floret development in the presence of excess GA. However, D9-1 mutants are unable to block GA-induced pistil development. Gene expression in developing tassels of D8-Mpl and D9-1 mutants and their wild-type siblings was determined upon excess GA\u2083 and mock treatments.

Genotype affected all GA-regulated phenotypes but there was no correlation between any of the GA-affected phenotypes, indicating that the complexity of the relationship between GA and development extends beyond the two-gene epistasis previously demonstrated for GA and brassinosteroid biosynthetic mutants.", "publication_date": "2022-10-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 112, "issue": 2, "first_page": 493, "last_page": 517, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20391976%20-%20The%20Plant%20Journal-2022-Best.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437338, "changed": 1709924226}, {"submission_node_id": 234, "submitter_email": "david.cameron@usda.gov", "submitter_name": "DAVID A.

BRs function through a signaling pathway to extensively regulate gene expression and TORC is known to regulate translation and autophagy. Recent studies revealed crosstalk between these two pathways, but a system-wide view of their interplay is still missing. Thus, we quantified the level of 23,181 transcripts, 11,238 proteins, and 27,886 phosphorylation sites in wild-type Arabidopsis as well as mutants with altered levels of either BIN2 or RAPTOR1B, two key players in BR and TORC signaling, respectively. We found that perturbation of BIN2 or RAPTOR1B levels affects a common set of gene-products involved in growth and stress responses. Furthermore, we used the multi-omic data to reconstruct an integrated signaling network. We screened 42 candidate genes identified from the integrated network and found that loss of function mutants of many of these proteins led to an altered BR response and/or modulated autophagy activity. Altogether, these results establish a predictive network that defines the molecular interactions of BR and TORC in the regulation of plant growth/stress balance.", "publication_date": "2022-11-01", "date_other": "", "volume": 236, "issue": 3, "first_page": 893, "last_page": 910, "manuscript_file": "https://submit.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/manuscripts/Log%20392431%20-%20Montes_2022.pdf", "manuscript_version": "openaccess_vor", "supplementary_files": "", "accession_number": "", "log_number": "", "created": 1670437331, "changed": 1709826596}]
