This paper reports a malignant melanoma in a captive spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis) and is the first case of melanoma reported in any native Australian murid. With no exposure to ultraviolet radiation the melanoma is proposed to be the result of genetic predisposition and age. As no other reports have been observed in the colony it is likely to be a very rare event in captivity and unlikely to occur in the wild.", "keywords": "cancer, disease, rodent, wildlife."}}
