    <Abstract>The United Nations marks responsible consumption and production as one of the 17 key goals to fulfill the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this context, affordable precision instruments can play a significant role in the optimization of crops in developing countries where precision agriculture tools are barely available. In this work, a simple to use, cost-effective instrument for spectral analysis of plants and fruits based on open-source hardware and software has been developed. The instrument is a 7-band spectrophotometer equipped with a microprocessor that allows one to acquire the reflectance spectrum of samples and compute up to 9 vegetation indices. The accuracy in reflectance measurements is between 0.4% and 1.4% full scale, just above that of high-end spectrophotometers, while the precision at determining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is 0.61%, between 3 and 6 times better than more expensive commercial instruments. Some use cases of this instrument have been tested, and the prototype has proven to be able to precisely monitor minute spectral changes of different plants and fruits under different conditions, most of them before they were perceptible to the bare eye. This kind of information is essential in the decision-making process regarding harvesting, watering, or pest control, allowing precise control of crops. Given the low cost (less than USD 100) and open-source architecture of this instrument, it is an affordable tool to bring precision agriculture techniques to small farmers in developing countries.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Statistical surveys about rabbits in households brought interesting results about their breeding. The survey shows that approx. 8.3% of Slovak households breed rabbits, of which the majority are bred in the countryside (61%), followed by breeding in cities (35%), and 4% of households stated both options. As part of the investigation, information was also obtained on the method of breeding rabbits. The results showed that housing with the restriction of movement is the predominant breeding method. Housing without the restriction of movement is higher in cities compared to rural areas, while free breeding is absent in households for both options. The information on excrement recovery showed that approximately 59.5% of all farm waste is composted, 15.8% of respondents said that they apply farm excrement to the soil, and the remaining respondents did not answer. The post-processing survey results led to new estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from domestic rabbit farming. The emissions were estimated using the methodology of the tier 2 approach outlined in the IPCC 2019 Refinement. The results indicated that rabbit breeding in households and farms in Slovakia generates an average of 0.51 Gg of methane and 0.13 Gg of nitrous oxide annually. Additionally, when free-range rabbit breeding is considered, emissions are 0.001 Gg of nitrous oxide. These greenhouse gas emissions from rabbit farming contribute to 7% of the total emissions from animal farming, ranking it as the third highest emitter after sheep. Consequently, it is imperative to prioritize the inclusion of this category in Slovakia&rsquo;s national emissions report.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The high concentration of China&rsquo;s barley import sources determines that China&rsquo;s barley import trade is vulnerable to the impact of tariff policy adjustment. In particular, in 2020, China implemented anti-dumping and anti-subsidy policies against Australia, the largest source of barley imports. Therefore, whether China&rsquo;s barley import trade will face import risks due to the adjustment of tariff policy has become a question worth discussing. Based on the above background, this study uses the partial equilibrium model to explore the impact of China&rsquo;s adjustment of tariff policy on imported barley from Australia on China&rsquo;s barley industry under the changing trade relations between China and Australia. Through analyzing the feasibility of developing domestic barley industry and expanding barley import sources, further explore strategies to deal with barley import trade risks. The results show that: Under the three import tariff adjustment simulations, the total import volume of China&rsquo;s barley shows a downward trend, and the import price increases to varying degrees. However, the relatively small increase in domestic production suggests that the domestic barley market is less able to cope with the risk of a sharp drop in imports. At the same time, affected by the adjustment of tariff policy, some Chinese consumer demand is difficult to satisfy. China can deal with trade risks by implementing an import diversification strategy.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To investigate the pore structure distribution and the coupled heat and moisture transfer during the drying process of the grains, this study focuses on fixed-bed corn drying with varying levels of broken kernel rate. A model of internal flow and conjugate heat and mass transfer was established for the drying process. Random packing models of whole and half corn kernels with different proportions were generated using rigid body dynamics (RBD), and the porosity, airflow distribution, and coupling of temperature and moisture transfer in fixed beds with different levels of broken kernel rate were analyzed. A fixed-bed corn drying device was developed, and the effects of broken particle contents of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% on drying characteristics were studied. The research findings reveal that the radial porosity in the fixed bed exhibits an oscillating distribution, with the localized porosity decreasing as the broken kernel rate increases. Increasing the broken kernel rate intensifies the curvature of the airflow paths within the fixed bed, increasing the pressure drop in the bed. The broken kernels fill the gaps between the whole kernels, improving the uniformity of the velocity distribution within the fixed bed. Under various packing models, the average discrepancy between pressure drop obtained from Particle-resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (PRCFD) simulations with experimental remains below 15%. The increase in broken kernel rate within the fixed bed enlarges the heat transfer area, resulting in an elevation of the transient heat transfer characteristic parameters during drying. Simultaneously, the broken kernel rate increases the surface area of mass transfer, thereby enhancing the moisture transfer rate within the fixed bed. Compared to the fixed bed without broken kernels (0%), which requires 560 min to dry the corn pile to a safe moisture of 14% (d.b.), the drying time is reduced by 60 min, 100 min, and 130 min for the respective broken kernel contents of 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively. The PRCFD method successfully simulates the processes of convective heat and mass transfer in the fluid phase and thermal and mass diffusion in the solid phase, exhibiting a strong correlation with experimental data.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The objective of the study was to determine the factors that influence the perceptions of smallholder farmers towards the adoption of digital technologies. A purposively selected sample of 250 smallholder farmers who were cross-sectionally surveyed from Port St Johns and Ingquza Hill Local Municipalities in South Africa was used in the study. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Attention, Desire, and Action (AIDA) model were used to analyse the data. The results showed that digital technologies were perceived to be expensive, cause a digital divide, and discouraged the use of Indigenous Knowledge even though they increased production. Positive perception towards digital technologies was associated with cattle rearing, with extreme negative perception for sheep and goat rearing. Educational level, employment status, monthly income, household size, being part of a cooperative (1% level), age, and source of income (10% level) were significant factors affecting smallholder farmers&rsquo; perceptions of digital technologies. In conclusion, there are economic, social justice, and traditional perceptions towards digital technologies by smallholder farmers, with socio-economic factors affecting the perceptions. The study recommends providing low-cost digital technologies that promote Indigenous Knowledge, which should target the youth and young farmers with less education in small households who are full-time farmers with moderate-to-high incomes and are part of farmer groups/organisations.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Cadmium (Cd) is considered one of the most toxic heavy metals to living organisms, being very persistent in soil and non-biodegradable, thus posing a long-term hazard to plants and humans. In recent years, the application of different molecules at the seed level, known as chemical seed priming, has been studied as a method to improve stress tolerance in plants. In the present study, we tested the effect of hydro-priming and proline priming of lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i> L.) seeds on germination, photosynthetic pigments, and metal metabolism under cadmium stress. Plants primed with proline showed better germination under cadmium stress (100% versus 84% for non-primed and hydro-primed seeds). Priming with 20 mM of proline increased the chlorophyll <i>a</i> and total chlorophyll contents by 40.8% and 18.6%, respectively, while these parameters decreased in other seedlings under Cd stress. Similarly, 20 mM of proline improved the uptake of Zn and Fe in roots under Cd stress. This indicates that 20 mM of proline treatments may be beneficial for maintaining a normal photosynthetic capacity and mineral uptake under Cd stress, but further metabolomics and transcriptomic data should reveal the exact mechanisms of action.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Talent revitalization is the basis of rural revitalization, and the return of migrant workers to their hometowns is a critical way to improve rural human capital. Based on the perspective of individual&ndash;family interaction and collaboration, we constructed a theoretical model for maximizing the net benefits of rural migrant workers. Then, we use it to explore the impact of family support pressure and urban housing purchase on individuals&rsquo; homecoming decisions. Firstly, we find the odds ratio of migrant workers with support pressure to return home is 14.013 times higher than those without, and the odds ratio of migrant workers with urban housing is 42.94% lower than those without. Secondly, in the process of supporting, the family, as a link between individuals and rural society, can enhance the connection for migrant workers, thus promoting their return behavior. The mediating effect of hometown connection is 1.342, accounting for 50.83% of the total effect. However, buying a house in the city reduces individuals&rsquo; homecoming behaviors by encouraging &ldquo;trailing spouse&rdquo;. Thirdly, individuals&rsquo; homecoming intention is not consistent with their behavior. The moderating effect of a future house purchase plan changes the influence of support pressure on individuals&rsquo; intention to return home to some extent. Finally, we should further strengthen rural infrastructure construction and elderly care service supply to reasonably guide capable and willing talents to return to the township. This study provides some implications for the revitalization of rural talent.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>For the issues of the poor stability of the furrow opener depth, large soil backfill depth, and inconsistent furrow shape on a no-till seeder for planting green manure between rows of orchards in South Xinjiang, a double-disc, corrugated furrow opener is designed. This paper analyzes the law of soil movement between corrugated double-disc and traditional double-disc furrow openers using the discrete element method (DEM) and concludes that the corrugation width and number of corrugations on the corrugated double-disc furrow opener are the primary factors affecting furrowing operation. When the number of corrugations is sixteen, the forward speed is six kilometers per hour, and when the corrugation width is seventeen and a half millimeters, the simulation operation parameters are optimal. The soil-bin validation experiment results are as follows: Under the condition of an 80 mm furrow depth, the stability of the average furrow depth is enhanced by 3.54%, the working resistance and the average disrupted soil area are increased by 26.16 N and 220 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and the backfill depth is decreased by 10.98 mm. The operation effect of a double-disc furrow opener with corrugated discs is enhanced by the high stability of the furrow depth, low working resistance, and small backfill depth. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the furrow opener components of a no-till seeder for planting green manure between rows of orchards.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study introduces the fuzzy theory approach as an enhancement to the traditional failure mode, effect, and criticality analysis (FMECA) method in order to address its limitations, which primarily stem from subjectivity and a lack of quantitative analysis. The proposed method, referred to as FMECA improvement based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, aims to quantify the qualitative aspect of the analysis and provides a detailed outline of the analysis procedure. By applying the enhanced FMECA method to assess the reliability of an intelligent profiling progressive automatic rubber cutter, the hazard ranking for each failure mode of the cutter can be determined, thereby identifying areas that require reliability improvement. The analysis outcomes demonstrate that this method establishes a theoretical foundation for subsequent cutter improvement designs, enables early identification of potential failures, and consequently leads to a reduced failure rate and an enhanced reliability level for the intelligent profiling progressive automatic cutter. Furthermore, this innovative agricultural equipment reliability analysis and testing approach holds significant value in elevating the reliability standards of agricultural equipment as a whole and can be explored and implemented in other agricultural machinery contexts.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study aimed to identify the key factors that may influence farmers&rsquo; support for organic farming, which is an eco-friendly approach that nourishes the productivity of agricultural and ecological systems. To explore farmers&rsquo; adoption of organic-agriculture-related behaviors and the factors that influence these behavioral intentions, this research developed a questionnaire based on Kaiser&rsquo;s theory of ecological behavior. The participants were 152 farmers, who were recruited via stratified sampling from four major agricultural zones in the county. The results revealed that environmental knowledge, environmental value, and feelings of responsibility positively influenced farmers&rsquo; behavioral intentions toward organic agriculture. The positive influence of environmental knowledge on behavioral intentions was enhanced by farmers&rsquo; experience, age, and time spent in agriculture each week. However, the positive influences of environmental value and feelings of responsibility were not moderated by the three aforementioned variables. Appropriate promotional and educational measures should incorporate the real-life experiences of farmers to increase their environmental knowledge, environmental value, and feelings of responsibility toward organic agriculture, thereby effectively enhancing their willingness to adopt this type of agriculture.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the preferences of Romanian consumers when purchasing agri-food products, with a focus on products from family farms, and to identify pathways for promoting family farms&rsquo; outputs for enhancing the development of rural areas and the local economy. For this, a survey was carried out using a questionnaire as the main tool. Firstly, the data collected were analysed from a descriptive point of view. Then, multiple linear regression and the chi-square test were used to determine the relationships between variables, and ANOVA was used to identify significant differences between groups. The results revealed that consumers with a higher level of education are more confident in certified products and are better informed, with a greater ability to distinguish certified from non-certified products through logos. Finally, the results indicate an opportunity for family farms to sell their products for a higher price within a secure market, mainly in urban areas. However, for this to happen, it is necessary to implement a quality scheme, highlighting the origin and originality of the product (product obtained from a family farm, including logo) coupled with awareness campaigns on the advantages that this product has, both for the consumer and the farmer or the region it comes from. These aspects could improve the development of rural areas from all points of view.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Sunflower is an important crop that is susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for implementing appropriate management strategies. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in the field of disease classification using image data. This study presents a comparative analysis of different deep-learning models for the classification of sunflower diseases. five widely used deep learning models, namely AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNet were trained and evaluated using a dataset of sunflower disease images. The performance of each model was measured in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrated that all the deep learning models achieved high precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy values for sunflower disease classification. Among the models, EfficientNetB3 exhibited the highest precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 0.979. whereas the other models, ALexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3 and MobileNetV3 achieved 0.865, 0.965, 0.954 and 0.969 accuracy respectively. Based on the comparative analysis, it can be concluded that deep learning models are effective for the classification of sunflower diseases. The results highlight the potential of deep learning in early disease detection and classification, which can assist farmers and agronomists in implementing timely disease management strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest that models like MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB3 could be preferred choices due to their high performance and relatively fewer training epochs.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The integration of hyperspectral imaging with machine learning algorithms has presented a promising strategy for the non-invasive and rapid detection of plant metabolites. For this study, we developed prediction models using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and boosting algo-rithms (such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM) for five metabolites in Brassica juncea leaves: total chlorophyll, phenolics, flavonoids, glucosinolates, and anthocyanins. To enhance the model performance, we employed several spectral data preprocessing methods and feature-selection al-gorithms. Our results showed that the boosting algorithms generally outperformed the PLSR models in terms of prediction accuracy. In particular, the LightGBM model for chlorophyll and the AdaBoost model for flavonoids improved the prediction performance, with R2p = 0.71&ndash;0.74, com-pared to the PLSR models (R2p = 0.53&ndash;0.58). The final models for the glucosinolates and anthocya-nins performed sufficiently for practical uses such as screening, with R2p = 0.82&ndash;0.85 and RPD = 2.4&ndash;2.6. Our findings indicate that the application of a single preprocessing method is more effective than utilizing multiple techniques. Additionally, the boosting algorithms with feature selection ex-hibited superior performance compared to the PLSR models in the majority of cases. These results highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging and machine learning algorithms for the non-destructive and rapid detection of plant metabolites, which could have significant implications for the field of smart agriculture.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The identification of a chicken&rsquo;s sex is a massive task in the poultry industry. To solve the problems of traditional artificial observation in determining sex, such as time-consuming and laborious, a sex identification method of chicken embryos based on blood vessel images and deep learning was preliminarily investigated. In this study, we designed an image acquisition platform to capture clear blood vessel images with a black background. 19,748 images of 3024 Jingfen No. 6 breeding eggs were collected from days 3 to 5 of incubation in Beijing Huadu Yukou Poultry Industry. Sixteen thousand seven hundred sixty-one images were filtered via color sexing in 1-day-old chicks and constructed the dataset of this study. A sex identification model was proposed based on an improved YOLOv7 deep learning algorithm. An attention mechanism CBAM was introduced for YOLOv7 to improve the accuracy of sex identification of chicken eggs; the BiFPN feature fusion was used in the neck network of YOLOv7 to fuse the low-level and high-level features efficiently; and &alpha;-CIOU was used as the bounding box loss function to accelerate regression prediction and improve the positioning accuracy of the bounding box of the model. Results showed that the mean average precision (mAP) of 88.79% was achieved by modeling with the blood vessel data on day 4 of incubation of chicken eggs, with the male and female reaching 87.91% and 89.67%. Compared with the original YOLOv7 network, the mAP of the improved model was increased by 3.46%. The comparison of target detection model results showed that the mAP of our method was 32.49%, 17.17%, and 5.96% higher than that of SSD, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv5, respectively. The average image processing time was 0.023 s. Our study indicates that using blood vessel images and deep learning has great potential applications in the sex identification of chicken embryos.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Screening for elite sugarcane genotypes for canopy cover in a rapid and non-destructive way is important to accelerate varietal/clonal selection, and little information is available regarding canopy cover and leaf production, leaf area, biomass production, and cane yield in sugarcane crop. In the present investigation, the digital images of sugarcane crop by using <i>Canopeo</i> software was assessed for their correlation with the physiological and morphological parameters and cane yield production. The results revealed that among the studied parameters, canopy coverage has shown a significantly better correlation with the plant height (0.581 **), leaf length (0.853 **), leaf width (0.587 **), and leaf area (0.770 **) in commercial sugarcane clones. Two-way cluster analysis has led to the identification of Co 0238, Co 86249, Co 10026, Co 99004, Co 94008, and Co 95020 with better physiological traits for higher sugarcane yield under changing climate. Additionally, in another field experiment with pre-breeding, germplasm, and interspecific hybrid sugarcane clones, the canopy coverage showed a significantly better correlation with germination, shoot count, leaf weight, leaf area index, and plant height, and finally with biomass (<i>r</i> = 0.612 **) and cane yield (<i>r</i> = 0.458 **). It has been found that the plant height, total dry matter (TDM), and leaf area index (LAI) had significant correlation with the cane yield, and the canopy cover data from digital images act as a surrogate for these traits, and further it has been observed that CC had better correlation with cane yield compared to the other physiological traits viz., SPAD, total chlorophyll (TC), and canopy temperature (CT) under ambient conditions. Light interception determined using a line quantum sensor had a significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.764 **) with canopy coverage, signifying the importance of determining the latter in a non-destructive way in a rapid manner and low cost.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Subsurface (or tile) drainage improves land productivity by enhancing soil aeration and preventing water-logged conditions. However, the continuous expansion of drained agricultural lands and reliance on synthetic fertilizer in the Midwestern United States have increasingly facilitated nitrate transport from agricultural fields to surface water bodies. Hence, there is a need to implement various agricultural best management practices (BMPs) in order to reduce the adverse water quality impacts resulting from excess nitrate, such as eutrophication and the formation of hypoxic zones. In this study, we used a SWAT+ model to assess the overall impacts on the riverine nitrate load and crop yield in the corn&ndash;soybean cropping system based on a combination of different management practices. The corn and soybean yields simulated with the model were found to be in good agreement with the observed yields for both the calibration and validation periods. The long-term simulation over a period of 30 years showed a reduction in the nitrate load of up to 32% without impacting the crop yield. The model results suggest that by reducing the current N application rate by 20% and using a 40:60 split between spring pre-plant and side-dressing N applications combined with cereal rye as a cover crop in corn&ndash;soybean rotation, one can potentially reduce nitrate losses without impacting crop yields. This study will help researchers, stakeholders, and farmers to explore and adopt alternative management practices beneficial for offsetting the environmental impacts of agricultural productions on the watershed scale.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Taktic, an Amitraz-based insecticide, is commonly used in sub-Saharan Africa to treat cattle for ticks. Due to misuse in rural dipping pools, some ticks are showing resistance to Taktic. This work presents a low-cost e-nose with commercial sensors to monitor Taktic levels in dipping pool water. The device shows distinctly different measurements for the odours of air, distilled water, farm water, and four levels of Taktic insecticide in farm water. A naive Bayes algorithm with a Gaussian distribution is trained on the data and a validation set achieves a 96.5% accuracy. This work also compares two sol-gel ZnO nanoparticle solutions with an off-the-shelf ZnO nanoparticle ink for use as active material in chemiresistive gas sensors to be employed in an e-nose array. The ZnO solutions are screen-printed onto gold electrodes, auto-sintered with a built in heater, and used with UV illumination to operate as low-power, room temperature gas sensors. All of the screen-printed ZnO sensors show distinct changes in resistance when exposed to Taktic vapours under room temperature and humidity conditions. The custom room temperature ZnO gas sensors fabricated via facile and low-cost processes are suitable for future integration in a point-of-need microsystem for the detection of Taktic in water.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Existing deep learning methods usually adopt deeper and wider network structures to achieve better performance. However, we found that this rule does not apply well to crop disease identification tasks, which inspired us to rethink the design paradigm of disease identification models. Crop diseases belong to fine-grained features and lack obvious patterns. Deeper and wider network structures will cause information loss of features, which will damage identification efficiency. Based on this, this paper designs a very lightweight disease identification network called VLDNet. The basic module VLDBlock of VLDNet extracts intrinsic features through 1 &times; 1 convolution, and uses cheap linear operations to supplement redundant features to improve feature extraction efficiency. In inference, reparameterization technology is used to further reduce the model size and improve inference speed. VLDNet achieves state-of-the-art model (SOTA) latency-accuracy trade-offs on self-built and public datasets, such as equivalent performance to Swin-Tiny with a parameter size of 0.097 MB and 0.04 G floating point operations (FLOPs), while reducing parameter size and FLOPs by 297 times and 111 times, respectively. In actual testing, VLDNet can recognize 221 images per second, which is far superior to similar accuracy models. This work is expected to further promote the application of deep learning-based crop disease identification methods in practical production.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Dairy farming requires forages with high neutral detergent fiber (NDF) to maximize milk production, sustain cows&rsquo; health, and ensure the economic and environmental sustainability of the dairy farm. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of the brown midrib (BMR) genotype, agronomic environment, and maturity at harvest on the NDF digestibility (NDFD) and the composition of the cell wall of corn plant tissues. In this plot study, one conventional and one BMR corn hybrid were planted and subjected to an abundant (60,000 seeds/ha and 225 kg N/ha) and a limited (90,000 seeds/ha and 180 kg N/ha) environment. The ruminal NDFD was determined in vitro in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and stem internodes. Cell walls from BMR corn had greater NDFD than cell walls from conventional corn on most tissues. Relative to the abundant environment, the limited environment had minimal effects on NDFD. As maturity advanced, NDFD decreased for various but not all tissues. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, intrinsic characteristics of corn, such as genotype and maturity at harvest, had a greater effect on NDFD than environment or agronomic management.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Avena magna</i> (2n = 4x = 28) is a tetraploid oat with a very high protein content compared to the hexaploid common oat, <i>A. sativa</i> (2n = 6x = 42). The wild type of <i>A. magna</i> originates from Morocco; its domestication has been achieved only within the past 25 years. The present study aimed to evaluate the productivity potential of an <i>A. magna</i> ssp. <i>domestica</i> collection of 11 advanced lines and a control variety, &lsquo;Avery&rsquo;. Twelve trials were conducted during three cropping seasons at four, three, and five locations and revealed significant differences among the accessions. Data on twelve agro-morphological characters and two disease traits were collected, and they confirmed the presence of variability in this oat germplasm set. Mean grain yield was 30.76 q/ha and varied from site to site, ranging from 6.89 q/ha at Bouchane_19 to 85.5 q/ha at Alnif_21. Across experimental sites, plant height ranged from 48.93 to 120.47 cm; thousand kernel weight from 32.83 to 49.73 g; and harvest index from 20.43 to 31.33%. Line AT6 was relatively tolerant of BYDV and crown rust infections, based on disease severity scoring at the heading stage. According to AMMI analysis, 78% of the grain yield variability was due to the environment factor and 4% was explained by the genetic factor. Among the highest-yielding lines, AT5 and ATC were relatively unstable. Line AT5 was more productive at the elevated site of El Kbab_19, and ATC performed better at the oasis location of Alnif_21 under irrigation. Line AT7 showed the most stable behavior; it was high yielding across the five environments and exceeded the general mean of the experiments. The <i>A. magna</i> ssp. <i>domestica</i> lines proved their suitability for cultivation under local farming conditions. Their nutritional quality, especially their high protein content, makes them good candidates for further testing in the Moroccan breeding program and for integration into local cropping systems.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In order to solve the problem of the threshing performance of a large combine harvester being reduced due to the non-adjustable diameter of the threshing drum, a variable-diameter threshing drum with movable radial plates based on the principle of concentric regulation was studied. It was mainly composed of a mechanism for adjusting the diameter by moving the radial plates, six fixed threshing tooth rods, six retractable threshing tooth rods and the single piston rod hollow hydraulic cylinder. The threshing gap can be adjusted by a stepless change of the drum diameter. By using RecurDyn simulation and field performance tests, the adjustable ranges of diameter and gap of the movable variable-diameter threshing drum were 670~710 mm and 10~30 mm. Based on the feed amount of the combine, the rotation speed of the threshing drum and the threshing gap (the diameter of the drum) as the influencing parameters, and the grain entrainment loss rate, grain un-threshed rate and grain breakage rate as the evaluation indexes, the three-factor and three-level response surface tests were carried out, and the result data were analyzed using Design-Expert 13.0. The optimal threshing gap and rotation speed of the threshing drum were determined under different feeding quantities. A comparative test was carried out to adjust and fix the threshing gap and rotation speed of the threshing drum in real time according to the change in feeding amount. The results showed that when the working parameter combination under different feeding amounts was adjusted in real time, the entrainment loss rate was 0.65%, the un-threshed rate was 0.063% and the breakage rate was 0.47%. Compared with the threshing gap and the rotation speed of the threshing drum being fixed, the entrainment loss rate, the un-threshed rate and the breakage rate were reduced by 44.9%, 27.6% and 34.1%, respectively. A threshing drum with variable diameter was provided for a large multi-crop harvesting combine to realize the concentric stepless adjustment of the threshing gap.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The process of plug tray seedling transplanting is a crucial step in protected agriculture production. Due to issues such as high labor intensity, poor consistency of work quality, and low efficiency, the application of automated transplanting machines has provided a solution to these issues. For the diversity of transplanting operations, various mechanical structures and technological applications have been developed for automated transplanting equipment. Therefore, this paper provides systematic research of current studies on the key transplanter technologies. Firstly, through an analysis of the types of transplanting operations, the technical requirements of automated transplanting equipment for different operation types are elucidated. Subsequently, the key technologies applied in transplanting machines are discussed from the perspectives of substrate physical characteristics, end effectors, integration of multiple end effectors, vision systems, and transplanting path planning. Moreover, an analysis is conducted on the advantages, disadvantages, and application scenarios of different research methods for each key technology. Lastly, the existing problems and technical difficulties of the transplanting machine are summarized, and future research directions are discussed. This analysis provides a valuable reference for further research and development in the field of transplanting machines for plug tray seedlings.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The environment in livestock and poultry houses plays an important role in the growth and reproduction of livestock and poultry. In order to obtain the environmental conditions of livestock and poultry houses in a timely and reliable manner, and eliminate adverse environmental factors, scholars have been exploring various methods to obtain and predict environmental factors. This paper reviewed the literature from the last 10 years, specifically focusing on technologies for detecting environmental factors in livestock and poultry houses, which can be mainly divided into three categories: research on the environmental monitoring and control of livestock and poultry houses based on detection equipment and wireless sensor technology; research on the distribution and regularity of environmental factors in livestock and poultry houses based on a mathematical model; research on the environmental simulation and detection of livestock and poultry houses based on computer technology. The current testing methods have their advantages and disadvantages. When studying environmental factors, researchers should choose the most appropriate method for data acquisition according to the actual situation. The proposed recommendations for achieving this goal are as follows: (1) The control of environmental factors should be combined with the physiological response of livestock and poultry. The needs of animals should be considered; (2) Novel approaches need to be developed to integrate energy requirements into the environmental regulation of livestock and poultry houses; (3) It is necessary to research and develop control models and strategies that can predict the environment in the houses, and the transient simulation method should be further explored; (4) Improve environmental detection and control accuracy through the coupling of different technologies.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The presence of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. on laying hen farms turns out to be a major problem for public health reasons, mainly related to foodborne illnesses that may arise due to ingestion of contaminated eggs. When <i>Salmonella</i> spp. infection on farms is confirmed by laboratory analysis, animal health measures are applied on the establishment, including total elimination of animals. The aim of this study is to describe three different methods of managing <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i>-infected laying hen farms, all of which were used within the Moselle department (France). The methods chosen, culling, use of a mobile CO<sub>2</sub> container, or lethal injection with T-61, depend on specific starting conditions, including the number of birds and proximity to an authorized slaughterhouse. This study, therefore, helps to identify the main problems with each method and provides recommendations for improving the management of <i>Salmonella</i> spp.-infected laying hen farms, where antibiotics cannot be used.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The soluble solids content (SSC) of pears is mainly composed of sugars, organic acids, and other soluble substances and is one of the important indices used to measure the sweetness and quality of pear juice. The SSC of pears is mainly composed of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, esters, alcohols, phenols, flavonoids, and other compounds, and different groups within these compounds have different characteristic absorption peaks corresponding to different characteristic wavelengths. Traditional methods such as genetic algorithm (GA) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) models used for screening characteristic wavelengths are mainly based on statistical methods, and characteristic wavelengths are selected by finding the wavelengths related to the changes in the concentration of the target analytes. By ignoring the molecular structure and chemical properties of the target analytes and disregarding the influence of the groups of the compounds in the target analytes on the spectral characteristics, wavelengths that are not related to the target analytes may be selected, thus affecting the accuracy of the analytical results. In this paper, a partial least squares (PLS) model was established based on the characteristic wavelengths of CARS, GA, and LASSO algorithms, and the best least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was selected and compared with the characteristic wavelengths selected by group weighted fusion (GWF). The LASSO regression was validated by 10-fold cross-validation to select the appropriate regularization parameter, and the 33 characteristic wavelengths correlated with the SSC of pears were selected in the full spectral range, and the 9 characteristic wavelengths corresponding to the group response were weighted and fused and input into the PLS regression model. Using an established model, the coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the calibration set were 0.992 and 0.177%, respectively, and the <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> and RMSE of the test set were 0.998 and 0.128%, respectively. The <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of our LASSO&ndash;GWF&ndash;PLS prediction model was improved from 0.975 to 0.998, indicating that the LASSO&ndash;GWF&ndash;PLS method has very good prediction ability for detection of SSC in pears.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Wheat, the main source of protein in the human diet, is a staple food in many countries. The yields and technological quality of wheat grain depend on both the yielding potential of wheat and the properties of wheat grain that allow its safe storage. To a large extent, losses during storage are caused by storage pests. Grains of 46 wheat cultivars were used in the study (samples weighing 20 g of each variety in 10 replications), on which the development of the grain weevil <i>Sitophilus granarius</i> (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was observed (20 insects aged 3&ndash;4 days; sex ratio of 1:1). The laboratory study was carried out at constant temperature (27 OC) and humidity (75% relative humidity). The laboratory study demonstrated that the physicochemical parameters of grain (hardness, glassiness, flouriness, content of protein, sugars, starch, and crude fat), which are cultivar-dependent, can act as regulators of the development of the grain weevil. The main aim of the study was to develop recommendations regarding the breeding of wheat cultivars resistant to the foraging of S. granarius and which could therefore produce grain for longer storage, and to distinguish those that are more sensitive to the grain weevil and whose grain should therefore be supplied to the market more quickly. Knowledge of the resistance or susceptibility of individual cereal varieties to the feeding of storage pests may be useful in integrated grain storage management. Among the 46 wheat cultivars studied, five cultivars with the highest and five cultivars with the lowest susceptibility to foraging by <i>S. granarius</i> were identified. The highest inherent tolerance to the grain weevil was displayed by the following cultivars: KWS Livius, Bogatka, Speedway, Platin, and Julius; in contrast, the cultivars Askalon, Bamberka, Ostroga, Forum, and Muszelka proved to be the most sensitive. The chemical and physical analysis of the selected cultivars revealed a significant, positive correlation between the intensity of the development of the grain weevil, the content of starch and crude fat in the grain, and grain hardness and flouriness.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Salinity stress acts as a significant deterrent in the course of optimal plant growth and productivity, and mung bean, being a relay crop in the cereal cropping system, is severely affected by salinity. Silicon (Si), on the other hand, has exhibited promising outcomes with regards to alleviating salinity stress. In order to understand the critical mechanisms underlying mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i> L.) tolerance towards salt stress, this study examined the effects of different salinity concentrations on antioxidant capacity, proteome level alterations, and influence on Si-transporter and salt-responsive genes. Salinity stress was seen to effect the gaseous exchange machinery, decrease the soluble protein and phenolic content and NR activity, and increase the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. An efficient regulation of stomatal opening upon Si application hints towards proficient stomatal conductance and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, resulting in efficient photosynthesis leading to proficient plant growth. The soluble protein and phenolic content showed improved levels upon Si supplementation, which indicates an optimal solute transport system from source to sink. The content of superoxide radicals showed a surge under salinity stress treatment, but efficient scavenging of superoxide radicles was noted under Si supplementation. Salinity stress exhibited more damaging effects on root NR activity, which was notably enhanced upon Si supplementation. Moreover, the beneficial role of Si was further substantiated as there was notable Si accumulation in the leaves and roots of salinity-stressed mung bean plants. Furthermore, Si stimulated competent ROS scavenging by reinforcing the antioxidant enzyme activity, as well coordinating with their isozyme activity, as expressed by the varying band intensities. Similarly, the Si-mediated increase in peroxidase activity may reveal changes in the mechanical characteristics of the cell wall, which are in turn associated with salinity stress adaptation. Proteomic investigations revealed the upregulation or downregulation of several proteins, which were thereafter identified by LC&minus;MS/MS. About 45 proteins were identified and were functionally classified into photosynthesis (24%), metabolic process (19%), redox homeostasis (12%), transmembrane transport (10%), stress response (7%), and transcription regulation (4%). The gene expression analysis of the silicon transporter genes (<i>Lsi1</i>, <i>Lsi2</i>, and <i>Lsi3</i>) and SOS pathway genes (<i>SOS1</i>, <i>SOS2,</i> and <i>SOS3</i>) indicated the role of silicon in mitigating salinity stress. Hence, the findings of this study can facilitate a profound understanding of the potential mechanisms adopted by mung bean due to exogenous Si application during salinity stress.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The application of camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives to control insect pests has generated significant interest. This study investigated the enzymatic response of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes in the fat body cells of <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> after 10 &mu;M CPT treatment. Additionally, we examined the effects of CPT on the growth and development of <i>S. exigua</i> larvae and detected the relative expression levels of selected CYP and GST genes during the CPT treatment period. Twenty-one CYP and 17 GST genes were identified from the fat body cells of <i>S. exigua</i> by comparative transcriptomic analyses. The relative expression of ten CYP and seven GST genes changed significantly, which suggested that these CPYs and GSTs may be involved in CPT metabolism. During exposure to CPT for 10 days, the development of <i>S. exigua</i> larvae was delayed and was characterized by weight inhibition and a prolonged period of development. The relative expression levels of the selected four CYP genes, <i>CYP9A27</i>, <i>CYP9A186</i>, <i>CYP337B5</i>, <i>CYP321A8</i>, and one GST gene, <i>GSTe7</i>, were significantly changed by CPT treatment compared to the control group. These generated data provide a basis for identifying the CPT metabolism/detoxification genes of <i>S. exigua</i> at the molecular level.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Pruning branches of apple trees is a labor-intensive task. Pruning robots can save manpower and reduce costs. A full map of the apple orchard with collision-free paths, which is navigation planning, is essential. To improve the navigation efficiency of the apple tree pruning robot, an improved RRT-Connect algorithm was proposed. Firstly, to address the disadvantage of randomness in the expansion of the RRT-Connect algorithm, a goal-biased strategy was introduced. Secondly, to shorten the path length, the mechanism of the nearest node selection was optimized. Finally, the path was optimized where path redundancy nodes were removed, and Bezier curves were used to deal with path sharp nodes to further reduce the path length and improve the path smoothness. The experimental results of apple orchard navigation show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper can cover the whole apple orchard, and the path length is 32% shorter than that of the RRT-Connect algorithm. The overall navigation time is 35% shorter than that of the RRT-Connect algorithm. This shows that the improved algorithm has better adaptability and planning efficiency in the apple orchard environment.

    <Abstract>Navigation line extraction is critical for precision agriculture and automatic navigation. A novel method for extracting navigation lines based on machine vision is proposed herein using a straight line detected based on a high-ridge crop row. Aiming at the low-level automation of machines in field environments of a high-ridge cultivation mode for broad-leaved plants, a navigation line extraction method suitable for multiple periods and with high timeliness is designed. The method comprises four sequentially linked phases: image segmentation, feature point extraction, navigation line calculation, and dynamic segmentation horizontal strip number feedback. The a* component of the CIE-Lab colour space is extracted to preliminarily extract the crop row features. The OTSU algorithm is combined with morphological processing to completely separate the crop rows and backgrounds. The crop row feature points are extracted using an improved isometric segmented vertical projection method. While calculating the navigation lines, an adaptive clustering method is used to cluster the adjacent feature points. A dynamic segmentation point clustering method is used to determine the final clustering feature point sets, and the feature point sets are optimised using lateral distance and point line distance methods. In the optimisation process, a linear regression method based on the Huber loss function is used to fit the optimised feature point set to obtain the crop row centreline, and the navigation line is calculated according to the two crop lines. Finally, before entering the next frame processing process, a feedback mechanism to calculate a number of horizontal strips for the next frame is introduced to improve the ability of the algorithm to adapt to multiple periods. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the efficiency requirements for visual navigation. The average time for the image processing of four samples is 38.53 ms. Compared with the least squares method, the proposed method can adapt to a longer growth period of crops.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In order to alleviate ecological environmental degradation and to enhance sustainable rural household livelihoods, the Shaanxi government of China launched a disaster mitigation program: the disaster avoidance resettlement. Measuring household livelihood vulnerability and further assessing its influence, hold the key to strengthening livelihood adaptation in the context of disaster resettlement. Taking Ankang&mdash;in southern Shaanxi Province, China&mdash;as an example, this article explores the impact mechanism of household livelihood vulnerability on adaptation strategies through a multinominal logistic regression model in which 657 rural questionnaires were employed. In order to provide more integrated empirical evidence, we draw lessons from the livelihood of the previously proposed vulnerability framework, which has three dimensions: the degree of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. The adaptive strategies were divided into pure farming, non-agricultural, and diversified adaptation types according to the types of income sources. The results indicated that livelihood vulnerability varies with different resettlement characteristics. In terms of adaptive strategy types, the vulnerability of pure farming households was the largest. This article found that the relocated households who had a lower sensitivity preferred the non-farming livelihood adaptation strategy. Local households with a high adaptive ability preferred to implement diversified adaptation strategies. The weaker the social support network of the relocated households, the more likely they were to choose off-farm adaptation strategies. Our research results are robust and have broader implications in terms of promoting rural household diversifications of adaptation strategies and reducing livelihood vulnerability.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Citrus orchards in Southeast Asia are commonly grown in hilly areas, where the terrain is unsuitable for the operation of crop protection machinery. Conventional spraying equipment used in hilly orchards have a poor deposition effect. In this paper, a new air-assisted electrostatic sprayer was designed for hilly citrus orchards. The orthogonal method was conducted to determine the optimal spray parameters of the sprayer. To evaluate the spray performance of the optimized air-assisted electrostatic sprayer, field tests were carried out on a citrus orchard with various cultivation patterns. Based on the data of the field tests, a comprehensive evaluation model was constructed to quantitatively analyze the performance of the sprayer. Results indicate that the optimal parameters are a spray pressure of 0.5 MPa, applied voltage of 9 kV and air flow velocity of 10 m/s. The optimized air-assisted electrostatic sprayer has the best performance in the citrus under dense fence cultivation pattern, followed by dense dwarf cultivation pattern. Comparing to the other sprayers tested, the air-assisted electrostatic sprayer greatly improves the spray coverage on the leaf surfaces (abaxial and adaxial) under various cultivation patterns.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To satisfy the increasing demand for soybeans, identifying and sorting high-vigor seeds before sowing is an effective way to improve the yield. Polarized hyperspectral imaging (PHI) technology is here proposed as a rapid, non-destructive method for detecting the vigor of naturally aged soybean seeds. First, the spectrum of 396.1&ndash;1044.1 nm was collected to automatically extract the region of interest (ROI). Then, first derivative (FD), Savitzky&ndash;Golay (SG), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and standard normal variate (SNV) preprocessed hyperspectral and polarized hyperspectral data (0&deg;, 45&deg;, 90&deg;, and 135&deg;) for the soybean seeds was obtained. Finally, the seed vigor prediction model based on polarized hyperspectral components such as I, Q, and U was constructed, and partial least squares regression (PLSR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and blending ensemble learning were applied for modeling analysis. The results showed that the prediction accuracy when using PHI was improved to 93.36%, higher than that for the hyperspectral technique, with a prediction accuracy up to 97.17%, 98.25%, and 97.55% when using the polarization component of I, Q, and U, respectively.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The invasive <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> is a serious pest for several fruit trees, causing millions of dollars of crop damage every year across the world&rsquo;s major fruit-growing regions. Once established in an orchard, <i>H. halys</i> quickly becomes the predominant stink bug species and is a major season-long pest. Annual increases in the population size of <i>H. halys</i> have resulted in increased pest pressure&nbsp;and a growing risk of severe crop damage. Reliable monitoring is indispensable for <i>H. halys</i> control and management, providing comprehensive information on the seasonality of pest population dynamics, abundance, and interaction with the environment, and is essential for the successful implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to prevent crop damage. Our study followed the seasonal population dynamics of <i>H. halys</i> in three apple orchards in the Gori&scaron;ka region of western Slovenia over the period 2019&ndash;2021. Pherocon<sup>&reg;</sup> Dual Panel Adhesive Traps (Trece Inc.) and pyramidal Rescue<sup>&reg;</sup> Stink Bug Traps, both baited with Tr&eacute;c&eacute; lures (two-component <i>H. halys</i> aggregation pheromone + pheromone synergist), were used to monitor <i>H. halys</i> adults and nymphs weekly from late March to the end of November. Captures taken with both types of trap clearly describe the seasonal dynamics of <i>H. halys</i>, with the first occurrence of overwintering adults in April and May, and with two&nbsp;peak occurrences in adults, in the middle of summer and in the beginning of autumn,&nbsp;corresponding to the appearance of two generations per year in the study area.&nbsp;The growing trap captures observed during the 3-year monitoring period suggest that <i>H. halys</i> was only recently introduced to the area and that natural enemies have not yet been fully recruited.&nbsp;Pyramid traps captured significantly more adults and nymphs than clear sticky traps and provided accurate monitoring of <i>H. halys</i> life stages throughout the season. Regardless of the lower trap catches of adults and juveniles, clear sticky traps clearly displayed <i>H. halys</i> seasonal dynamics pattern. Therefore, their use is recommended as an early detection tool in areas where pests are not yet present, or in areas with small <i>H. halys</i> populations. <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> adult trap captures were higher in &Scaron;empeter orchards, within areas of great landscape diversity and a large share of urban land. The seasonal dynamics of <i>H. halys</i> over the 3-year period were closely related to weather conditions, with temperature and relative humidity as the major factors affecting population growth.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>One of the most destructive insect species for stored maize is the larger grain borer, <i>Prostephanus truncatus</i>. Its control is challenging, as it seems to have a natural tolerance to active ingredients that are effective for other stored-product insect species that cause infestations in maize. The objective of the present study was to comparatively evaluate a wide range of insecticides that are currently in use in stored product protection for the control of <i>P. truncatus</i>. Specifically, three inert dusts&mdash;namely, a kaolin, a zeolite and a diatomaceous earth formulation&mdash;and three residual insecticides&mdash;i.e., the pyrethroid deltamethrin, the bacterial insecticide spinosad and the juvenile hormone analogue S-Methoprene&mdash;were evaluated against adults of <i>P. truncatus</i>. Adult mortality was assessed after 7, 14, 21 and 28 d of exposure, whereas progeny production was measured after an additional interval of 28 d for inert dusts and 65 d for the contact insecticides. Moreover, the number and weight of infested and uninfested kernels per vial was measured. Low mortality levels were recorded for the three inert dusts even for the highest application rate and after 28 d of exposure. Moreover, the inert dusts tested failed to suppress the progeny production of <i>P. truncatus</i>. In contrast, high mortality levels were recorded for deltamethrin and spinosad that exceeded 95% already after 7 d of exposure at the lowest application rate (0.5 ppm). The application of S-Methoprene did not result in high adult mortality rates, irrespective of the application rate and the evaluation interval. Deltamethrin, spinosad and S-Methoprene significantly suppressed progeny production of the species at the doses tested.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The paper hereby focuses on the essential field of soil evolution in relation to the effect of long-term fertilization on plant yields and the essential, evolutionary, and impactful changes in their fertility. NP fertilization (by application of ammonium nitrate and concentrated superphosphate) causes a change in soil reaction over time through acidification with increasing N doses, while phosphorus is able to partially mitigate this process. Acidic soil&mdash;the typical preluvosol&mdash;as a result of adsorbed acidity activation, solubilizes Al ions and may become interested in calcic amendment. Acidification tendencies are also maintained in the amended variants, but to a lesser extent due to the neutralizing capacity of the amendment and the presence of calcium ions. Complex NP fertilization in acid soil (preluvosol) cultivated with wheat can maintain a relatively constant humus content (%), but calcium amendment can cause a reduction of this indicator. In contrast, under maize, due to the effects of conventional tillage and intensive tillage, fertilization contributes to a reduction in this indicator, which is more active against the background of limestone amendment. The phenomenon can be explained by potentiation through the mineralization of the organic component of the soil. This effect is diminished in alluvial mollisol with a higher humus content, saturated in bases, and a buffering capacity. Organic and organo-mineral fertilization can control the modeling of soil humus content and its agrochemical status. The regime of essential elements (N, P, and K) becomes active in mobile forms, and the precarious supply conditions of the initial stage tend to improve. Applied superphosphate evolves, differentiated from the applied dose and pH, into non-occluded mineral forms (P-Al, P-Fe, and P-Ca), which supply the mobile forms in the soil solution for the plants, with the importance of maintaining, more of these forms at the level required by plants. In the case of potassium, the dynamics of its forms in the soil (unchangeable and exchangeable) control the soil supply state of this element and the effect of its application to plants. The data presented show that long-term experiments can effectively support the study of soil fertility through the soil-plant relationship.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To improve environmental quality in enclosed piggeries, a monitoring and control system was designed based on a track inspection robot. The system includes a track mobile monitoring platform, an environmental control system, and a monitor terminal. The track mobile monitoring platform consists of three main components: a single-track motion device, a main box containing electronic components, and an environmental sampling device. It is capable of detecting various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, NH<sub>3</sub> concentration, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, light intensity, H<sub>2</sub>S concentration, dust concentration, and wind speed at different heights below the track. Additionally, it can control on-site environmental control equipment such as lighting systems, ventilation systems, temperature control systems, and manure cleaning systems. The networked terminal devices enable real-time monitoring of field equipment operating status. An adaptive fuzzy PID control algorithm is embedded in the system to regulate the temperature of the piggery. Field tests conducted on a closed nursery piggery revealed that the system effectively controlled the maximum temperature range within 2 &deg;C. The concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and PM2.5 were maintained at a maximum of 1092 mg&#8729;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>, 16.8 mg&#8729;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>, and 35 &mu;g&#8729;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>, respectively. The light intensity ranged from 51 to 57 Lux, while the wind speed remained stable at approximately 0.35 m&#8729;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The H<sub>2</sub>S concentration was significantly lower than the standard value, and the lowest relative humidity recorded was 18% RH at high temperatures. Regular humidification is required in closed piggeries and other breeding places when the system does not trigger the wet curtain humidification and cooling function, as the relative humidity is lower than the standard value. By controlling the temperature, the system combined with a humidification device can meet environmental requirements. The control method is simple and effective, with a wide range of applications, and holds great potential in the field of agricultural environmental control.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Peanut southern blight has a severe impact on peanut production and is one of the most devastating soil-borne fungal diseases. We conducted a hyperspectral analysis of the spectral responses of plants to peanut southern blight to provide theoretical support for detecting the severity of the disease via remote sensing. In this study, we collected leaf-level spectral data during the winter of 2021 and the spring of 2022 in a greenhouse laboratory. We explored the spectral response mechanisms of diseased peanut leaves and developed a method for assessing the severity of peanut southern blight disease by comparing the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with traditional spectral indices and incorporating machine learning techniques. The results showed that the SVM model performed best and was able to effectively detect the severity of peanut southern blight when using CWT (WF<sub>770~780</sub>, 5) as an input feature. The overall accuracy (OA) of the modeling dataset was 91.8% and the kappa coefficient was 0.88. For the validation dataset, the OA was 90.5% and the kappa coefficient was 0.87. These findings highlight the potential of this CWT-based method for accurately assessing the severity of peanut southern blight.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Rice is a vital crop for global food security, but its production is vulnerable to various diseases. Early detection and treatment of rice diseases are crucial to minimise yield losses. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential for disease detection in plant leaves, but training CNNs requires large datasets of labelled images, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Here, we have experimented a 3-Stage CNN architecture with a transfer learning approach that utilises a pre-trained CNN model fine-tuned on a small dataset of rice disease images. The proposed approach significantly reduces the required training data while achieving high accuracy. We also incorporated deep learning techniques such as progressive re-sizing and parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) to enhance rice disease detection. Progressive re-sizing improves feature learning by gradually increasing image size during training, while PReLU reduces overfitting and enhances model performance. The proposed approach was evaluated on a dataset of 8883 and 1200 images of disease and healthy rice leaves, respectively, achieving an accuracy of 94% when subjected to the 10-fold cross-validation process, significantly higher than other methods. These simulation results for disease detection in rice prove the feasibility and efficiency and offer a cost-effective, accessible solution for the early detection of rice diseases, particularly useful in developing countries with limited resources that can significantly contribute toward sustainable food production.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Realizing high-quality and increased production of fresh corn and promoting diversified development of the corn industry structure not only can effectively promote the development of agricultural economy, but also can enrich people&rsquo;s dietary culture. However, existing fresh corn machinery has a high rate of ear damage during the harvesting process, and the overall harvesting efficiency is not ideal. To reduce damage during the harvesting of fresh corn, a device for breaking ears of fresh corn was designed based on the directional clamping of corn straw reverse breaking method. Based on the physico-mechanical characteristics parameters of fresh corn ears, the main structural parameters of the directional clamping and conveying mechanism and the ear-breaking mechanism were determined. The overall inclination angle of the device was 15&deg;, and the effective conveying length of the directional clamping mechanism was 550 mm; the ear-snapping mechanism was a snapping roll composed of a pair of six radial distribution function fingers, with an effective operating radius of 320 mm. By simulating and analyzing the reverse breaking movement of directional clamping corn straw, the key motion parameter ranges of the directional clamping conveying mechanism and breaking mechanism were obtained. The results of the bench test showed that under the optimal conditions of a directional clamping feeding speed of 1.67 m/s, a breaking wheel speed of 80 rpm, and a travel speed of 1.06 m/s, the lowest ear damage rate was 0.57%, and the lowest impurity rate was 1.87%. In addition, it was observed that flexible harvesting can improve harvest efficiency and quality. The study also found that actively applying force to the device can effectively avoid the problem of machine blockage and reduce the damage rate of ears (the following text uses ears instead of fresh corn ears).</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In recent years, the adverse effect of climate change on soil properties in the agricultural sector has become a dreadful reality worldwide. Climate change-induced abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought and temperature fluctuations are devastating crops&rsquo; physiological responses, productivity and overall yield, which is ultimately posing a serious threat to global food security and agroecosystems. The applications of chemical fertilizers and pesticides contribute towards further deterioration and rapid changes in climate. Therefore, more careful, eco-friendly and sustainable strategies are required to mitigate the impact of climate-induced damage on the agricultural sector. This paper reviews the recently reported damaging impacts of abiotic stresses on various crops, along with two emerging mitigation strategies, biochar and biostimulants, in light of recent studies focusing on combating the worsening impact of the deteriorated environment and climate change on crops&rsquo; physiological responses, yields, soil properties and environment. Here, we highlighted the impact of climate change on agriculture and soil properties along with recently emerging mitigation strategies applying biochar and biostimulants, with an aim to protecting the soil, agriculture and environment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>A series of four broiler performance studies were conducted in different facilities to investigate the efficacy of a novel bacterial 6-phytase added at 500 FTU/kg diet on growth performance, bone mineralization and precaecal digestibility of phosphorus (pcdP) in broilers fed diets deficient in available P (avP) and calcium (Ca). The experimental design was the same for all studies, with each having three treatments: positive control (PC) diet formulated to meet or exceed the requirements of birds, negative control (NC) diet similarly reduced by 0.15% points in avP and Ca compared to the PC diet, and the NC diet supplemented with phytase (PHY) at 500 FTU/kg diet from 1 to 35 days of age. Body weight (BW) and feed intake were measured at 21 and 35 days of age, and average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), BW gain-corrected-FCR (cFCR), mortality and European performance efficiency factor (EPEF) were calculated. Tibia dry matter, tibia ash content and pcd of P were measured at 21 days of age in all experiments. The analysis of the data from the four experiments showed that compared with birds fed the adequate-nutrient diet, birds fed the NC diet resulted in a decrease (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in BW, ADG, ADFI and EPEF by 6.4, 6.3, 5.9 and 7.1%, respectively, and an increase in (<i>p</i> = 0.02) cFCR by 2.0%. The tibia dry matter and tibia ash content of these birds were also reduced (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) by 3.8 and 4.0% points, respectively. PHY diets improved (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) BW, ADG, ADFI, EPEF and cFCR by 8.0, 8.3, 7.3, 10.6 and 2.8%, respectively. Phytase addition at 500 FTU/kg diet also increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) the tibia dry matter and tibia ash content by 3.5 and 4.2% points, respectively. The pcd of P was improved (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) by 11.1 and 11.3% points, in comparison with NC and PC diets, respectively, when phytase was added. These performance parameters and tibia mineralization obtained with a diet supplemented with phytase were comparable to or better than the PC diet. The results demonstrated that avP and Ca could be lowered similarly by 0.15% points in broilers diets by using the new bacterial 6-phytase at 500 FTU/kg diet.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Rice-fallow areas have significant potential to sustainably increase agricultural intensification to address growing global food demands while simultaneously increasing farmers&rsquo; income by harnessing the residual soil moisture in rainfed ecologies. Assam is the largest rice-growing belt in northeast India during <i>kharif</i>; however, for the next <i>rabi</i> season, an average of 58% of the rice areas remain uncultivated and are described as rice-fallow (<i>Kharif</i>, <i>rabi</i> and <i>zaid</i> are the crop seasons in the study area. The <i>kharif</i> season refers to the monsoon/rainy season and corresponds to the major crop season in the region extending from June to October. The <i>rabi</i> season refers to the winter season extending from November to April, and the <i>zaid</i> season is the summer crop season from April to June). Unutilized rice-fallow areas with optimum soil moisture for a second crop were identified over three consecutive years using multiple satellite data (optical and radar) for the state of Assam and an average accuracy of 92.6%. The reasons governing the existence of rice-fallow areas were analyzed, and an average of 0.88 million ha of suitable rice-fallow areas, based on soil moisture availability, were identified. Targeted interventions were carried out in selected locations to demonstrate the potential of sustainable cropping intensification. Maize, with best management practices, and a yield between 5.5 and 6 t/ha, was demonstrated as a successful second crop during the <i>rabi</i> season in selected areas with optimum residual soil moisture after the <i>kharif</i> paddy harvest. This study highlights the significance of geospatial technology to effectively identify and target suitable rice-fallow areas for cropping intensification and to enhance productivity and profitability.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Some researchers expect that future agriculture will be automated by swarms of small machines. However, small and light robots have some disadvantages. They have problems generating interaction forces high enough to modify the environment (lift a stone, cultivate the soil, or transport high loads). Additionally, they have limited range and terrain mobility. One option to change this paradigm is to use spikes instead of wheels, which enter the soil to create traction. This allows high interaction forces with the soil, and the process is not limited by the weight of the vehicle. We designed a prototype for mechanical soil cultivation and weeding in agricultural fields and evaluated its efficiency. A static and dynamic test was performed to compare the energy input of the electrical motor with precise measurements of the forces on the attached tool. The results indicate that the prototype can create interaction forces of up to 2082 N with a robot weight of 90 kg. A net traction ratio of 2.31 was reached. The dynamic performance experiment generated pull forces of up to 1335 N for a sustained net traction ratio of 1.48. The overall energy efficiency ratio for the machine reached values of up to 0.54 based on the created draft force and the measured input energy consumption.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Economic and ecosystem issues associated with beekeeping may stem from bee mites rather than other bee diseases. The honey mites that stick to bees are small and possess a reddish-brown color, rendering it difficult to distinguish them with the naked eye. Objective and rapid technologies to detect bee mites are required. Image processing considerably improves detection performance. Therefore, this study proposes an image-processing method that can increase the detection performance of bee mites. A keypoint detection algorithm was implemented to identify keypoint location and frequencies in images of bees and bee mites. These parameters were analyzed to determine the rational measurement distance and image-processing. The change in the number of keypoints was analyzed by applying five-color model conversion, histogram normalization, and two-histogram equalization. The performance of the keypoints was verified by matching images with infested bees and mites. Among 30 given cases of image processing, the method applying normalization and equalization in the RGB color model image produced consistent quality data and was the most valid keypoint. Optimal image processing worked effectively in the measured 300 mm data in the range 300&ndash;1100 mm. The results of this study show that diverse image-processing techniques help to enhance the quality of bee mite detection significantly. This approach can be used in conjunction with an object detection deep-learning algorithm to monitor bee mites and diseases.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The high-quality development of new agricultural business entities (NABEs) is an important driving force for realizing rural revitalization and accelerating the modernization of agriculture and rural areas. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the spatial distribution pattern, aggregation scales, development mechanism, and internal differences of various types of NABEs in different regions. It provides targeted ideas for alleviating regional differences in the development of NABEs in different agricultural regions. Kernel density estimation, nearest neighbor distance analysis, Tyson&rsquo;s polygon coefficient of variation, and Ripley&rsquo;s K function are used to study the spatial and temporal evolution, spatial aggregation, and scale divergence of various types of NABEs, and Pearson correlation analysis is incorporated to explore the specific factors affecting the development of various types of NABEs. The study results: First, family farms are the most widely distributed, and agricultural enterprises are the most sparsely distributed, being distributed &ldquo;more in the southeast and less in the northwest&rdquo; in all three categories. Second, the strongest aggregation scales of different NABEs are increasing, and the strongest aggregation scales of agricultural enterprises are larger than those of family farms and cooperatives in all agricultural areas. Third, the development of specialized farmers&rsquo; cooperatives (abbreviated as &lsquo;cooperatives&rsquo;) is more constrained by traditional agricultural inputs and is a kind of agricultural input-oriented development. Family farms are more constrained by the living standards of rural residents in the region and are a kind of rural economy-oriented development. Agricultural enterprises are more subject to the economic level of the region, which is a kind of market economy-oriented development. Finally, in the process of developing NABEs, regional differences should be emphasized, and a small number of agriculturally leading enterprises and model cooperatives should drive a large number of small-scale family farms and smallholder farmers in order to become a characteristic path for China&rsquo;s agricultural development.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Accurate semantic segmentation of disease spots is critical in the evaluation and treatment of cucumber leaf damage. To solve the problem of poor segmentation accuracy caused by the imbalanced feature fusion of SegFormer, the Efficient Channel Attention SegFormer (ECA-SegFormer) is proposed to handle the semantic segmentation of cucumber leaf disease spots under natural acquisition conditions. First, the decoder of SegFormer is modified by inserting the Efficient Channel Attention and adopting the Feature Pyramid Network to increase the scale robustness of the feature representation. Then, a cucumber leaf disease dataset is built with 1558 images collected from the outdoor experimental vegetable base, including downy mildew, powdery mildew, target leaf spot, and angular leaf spot. Tested on the dataset, the Mean Pixel Accuracy of ECA-SegFormer is 38.03%, and the mean Intersection over Union is 60.86%, which is 14.55% and 1.47% higher than SegFormer, respectively. These findings demonstrate the superiority of ECA-SegFormer over the original SegFormer, offering enhanced suitability for precise segmentation of cucumber leaf disease spots in the natural environment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Decision support system tools such as crop models and considering the uncertainties associated with them are important for making an informed decision to fill the yield gap in farms and increase food security. This study&rsquo;s objective was to identify and quantify the degree to which crop management practices, as well as climate and soil, affected the uncertainty of total biomass, evapotranspiration, and water productivity of silage maize by using a crop model and spatiotemporal input data. Using a calibrated crop model (DSSAT) and pSIMS platform, three planting dates by considering ten ensemble weather data and three soil profile data were simulated for the time period between 2002 and 2017 with a 2 km &times; 2 km resolution across maize production areas with arid and Mediterranean climates in Isfahan province, Iran. Additionally, the findings were used to determine the yield gap in the studied area to identify opportunities to boost food production. Our results showed larger uncertainty in Mediterranean climates than in arid climates, and it was more affected by planting date than weather parameters and soil profile. The accuracy of total biomass prediction by using pSIMS-CERES-Maize based on the spatiotemporal input data was 1.9% compared to field experimental data in the dry climate, and the yield gap based on the comparison of modified-pSIMS-CERES-Maize and reported biomass was 6.8 to 13 tons ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> in the arid and Mediterranean climate. Generally, all results represented the importance of using crop models and considering spatiotemporal data to increase reliability and accuracy, especially in Mediterranean climates, and their potential to increase food production in developing countries with limited water resources and poor agriculture management.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In Xinjiang, precision hole-sowing technology is used for cotton cultivation. A disc-type seed disperser has problems with missing seeds and multi-seeding; therefore, an interdigital (multiple pairs of coplanar electrodes crossed) capacitance sensor is designed to determine the seed pick-up status by gathering electrical capacity information. Firstly, a theoretical derivation is performed for calculating the capacitance of the sensor, and it is concluded that the interdigital spacing, interdigital width, and interdigital logarithm all affect the output capacitance. Then, by analyzing the working process of the dibble, the assemblage position of the sensor and the dimensional constraints were determined. In order to explore the impact of various structural parameters on the sensor&rsquo;s performance (signal strength and capacitance variation), a Maxwell simulation platform was established, and orthogonal tests were created to optimize the structural parameters. In addition, the STM32 microcontroller is utilized as the core, and it is linked with the PCAP01-AD chip to form a tiny capacitance-detecting circuit. Finally, the capacitance threshold division test determined the capacitance threshold at different seed states. The test results demonstrate that the interdigital capacitive sensor can accurately determine the precision dibble&rsquo;s seeding status, with detection accuracies of 96.9% for normal seeding, 99.67% for miss-seeding, and 93.77% for multiple seeds. These results can be used as a research reference for capacitive seeding status-detection technology.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In drylands, poor rains combined with high evaporation rates increase the risks of soil salinization in addition to drought stress. Here, we determined the values of the parameters in the Feddes root water uptake function for sesame (<i>Sesamum indicum</i> L.) under drought and salinity stresses in a pot experiment using &ldquo;Lebap-55&rdquo;, which has been bred for the drylands of the Aral Sea Basin but is moderately sensitive to salinity stress. We measured the hourly values of the transpiration, soil moisture, and salinity in the upper and lower soil layers in pots, solar radiation, and root distribution. The values were quantified by two methods. The bulk method uses only daily pot weight data, and the average soil water content and salt concentration are back-calculated from the mass balance. The inverse method uses the monitored values of the soil water content and salinity as well as daily weight data and solar radiation. Both methods could successfully estimate all the parameter values for both stresses. The bulk method performed better under drought stress, even without the measured soil water content or root distribution. It also had satisfactory accuracy in estimating the values under salinity stress. Both methods performed better under drought stress than under salinity stress. The parameter values determined here could be used for irrigation scheduling and salinity management using numerical models for the studied crop.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Agricultural production without pollution is possible using bioactive plant compounds, which include essential oils as important substances of plant origin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiphytoviral and antibacterial potentials of lipid (essential oil, EO) and water (hydrosol, HY) extracts from five <i>Veronica</i> species (Plantaginaceae) obtained by Clevenger hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), with analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antiphytoviral activities of both extracts were tested on local host plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The antibacterial potential was tested against ten strains of opportunistic pathogens using the broth microdilution test. Species <i>V. chamaedrys</i> EO-MAE extract, <i>V. arvensis</i> EO from both extractions and <i>V. montana, V. serpyllifolia</i>, and <i>V. persica</i> EO-HD extracts were more effective in inhibiting TMV infection. Furthermore, HY- HD extracts of <i>V. arvensis</i>, <i>V. chamaedrys</i> and <i>V. persica</i> showed significant antiphytoviral activity. HY fractions had no effect on bacterial growth, regardless of the <i>Veronica</i> species tested, likely due to the fact that the maximum concentrations of the HY fractions tested in this study were low (1.83 and 2.91 mg/mL). EOs showed significant antibacterial activity independent of the extraction method. Notably, <i>V. chamaedrys</i> EO-MAE fraction, showed significantly better activity against <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. Also, the EO-HD fraction of <i>V. arvensis</i> showed slightly better antibacterial activity. By combining extracts and using different extraction methods, valuable bioproducts can be obtained from the investigated <i>Veronica</i> species for safe use in agricultural production and food conservation.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Greenhouse cultivation technology has greatly contributed to the development of agriculture in Malaysia. Understanding how to monitor the greenhouse environment with high efficiency and low power consumption is particularly important. In this research, a wireless sensor network for agricultural greenhouses based on the improved Zigbee protocol is designed. Its hardware consists of various sensors and Zigbee nodes commonly used in agricultural greenhouses. On the basis of this hardware, this research designed the network topology of WMN (Wireless mesh network) by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various topologies, and combined with this structure, proposed an improved ZigBee routing protocol EMP-ZBR to solve the question regarding energy loss and the network congestion of wireless networks. After testing EMP-ZBR and traditional Zigbee routing protocols, the improved EMP-ZBR protocol is superior to traditional Zigbee routing in terms of the end-to-end average delay, packet delivery rate, routing control overhead and routing discovery frequency, which were optimized about 1.1%, 15.2%, 15.2%, 8.1 ms in different mobile pause times, and 9.8%, 19.3%, 15.7% and 121 ms in different packet sending rates. The agreement proves that EMP-ZBR can more effectively alleviate the impact of congestion and improve the overall performance of the data monitoring system for agricultural greenhouses.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The isolation of new bacterial strains from the natural environment can lead to the detection of microorganisms of potential practical importance. The characterization of such microorganisms can be carried out using classical microbiological and molecular biology methods. Currently, studies of newly detected microorganisms are based on sequencing techniques. Sequencing of the full genome can provide information about the origin of the strain, its taxonomic status, and phenotypic characteristics. The studies were conducted using the bacteria <i>Achromobacter</i> sp. 77Bb1 isolated from the maize crop rhizosphere. The bacterial genome was sequenced using Illumina 2 &times; 150 nt technology. The obtained sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics methods, resulting in 57 contigs and genome containing 6,651,432 nt. Phylogenetic analysis based on <i>16S rRNA</i> gene sequences enabled the assignment of the analyzed bacteria to the genus <i>Achromobacter</i>. The obtained genome contained genes for 4855 proteins with functional assignment. Some of these genes were connected with xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolisms. All genes for aminobenzoate degradation and almost all for benzoate and styrene degradation were found in the analyzed genome, suggesting that the isolated strain has the potential to be used in natural bioremediation methods.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>We propose an optimal system for determining the shipping schedule for pigs using a predictive model using machine learning based on big data. This system receives photographic and weight measurement information for each pig from a camera and a weighing machine installed in a pig pen for raising pigs corresponding to a predetermined fattening period. Then, the photographic information of each of these pigs is applied to a predictive model machine-learned in advance to determine whether or not there are candidate pigs for determining the presence or absence of abdominal fat-forming pigs. And if there is a candidate pig, it is determined using a machine-learning model for predicting whether the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig by analyzing the pattern of weight increase of the abdominal fat-forming pig and changes in weight of a candidate. If the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig, the timing of shipping is determined by predicting when the weight of the candidate pigs, specifically the abdominal fat-forming pigs, will reach a predetermined minimum shipping weight. This prediction is made using a machine-learning model that considers the weight gain trend pattern of abdominal fat-forming pigs and tracks changes in the weight of the candidate pig. A machine-learning model is used to predict the timing of weight gain in candidate pigs, specifically those that develop abdominal fat, in order to determine the optimal shipping time. By analyzing the weight gain patterns of abdominal fat-forming pigs and monitoring the weight changes in the candidate pig, the model can predict when the candidate pig will reach the minimum weight required for shipping. In this paper, we would like to present a point of view based on the body type and weight of pigs corresponding to the fattening period through this system, whether intramuscular fat has adhered or abdominal fat is excessively formed by the fed feed and appropriate shipment as the fattening status of pigs.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>A variable speed anti-tangling reel mechanism was designed to address the problems of tangling, hanging and rewinding of the tassel wheel and the high paddling loss in the current Chinese rape combine harvester cutting table. The kinematic equations of the reel mechanism were developed, and the analysis showed that the speed in the entry stage is low and the speed in the exit stage is high, and the attitude of the reel teeth change with the rape plant movement during the whole paddling process. A single-factor test and a multi-factor regression orthogonal combination test were carried out using the cutting table loss rate of rape harvesting as the evaluation index. The main and secondary factors affecting the cutting table loss of the variable speed reel were obtained as the reel input speed, the machine travel speed and the ground angle of the frame. The optimal range of the input speed of the reel is from 25 r&middot;min<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 31 r&middot;min<sup>&minus;1</sup>, the optimal range of the forward speed of the implement is 0.8 m&middot;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>~1 m&middot;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and the optimal range of the rack level angle is from &minus;10&deg;to 10&deg;. A mathematical model of regression of cutter loss and the main influencing factors was established, with the coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9918, the relative error between the test value and the optimised value of the regression equation was 5.36%. The optimal combination of parameters for the variable speed reel was obtained with the lowest cutting table loss rate in rape harvesting as the optimization target: reel input speed 25 r&middot;min<sup>&minus;1</sup>, frame parallel to the ground and implement travel speed 0.7 m&middot;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Field validation tests and comparative tests of cutting table loss of the two reels were carried out. The test results show that the regression mathematical model of the cutting table loss is more accurate, and the cutting table loss is reduced by 13.9% with the variable speed reel compared to the cam-action reel, and there are no problems with the paddle teeth hanging and tangling during the paddling process.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in animal husbandry, particularly in pig interaction recognition (PIR), offers a transformative approach to enhancing animal welfare, promoting sustainability, and bolstering climate resilience. This innovative methodology not only mitigates labor costs but also significantly reduces stress levels among domestic pigs, thereby diminishing the necessity for constant human intervention. However, the raw PIR datasets often encompass irrelevant porcine features, which pose a challenge for the accurate interpretation and application of these datasets in real-world scenarios. The majority of these datasets are derived from sequential pig imagery captured from video recordings, and an unregulated shuffling of data often leads to an overlap of data samples between training and testing groups, resulting in skewed experimental evaluations. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduced a groundbreaking solution&mdash;the Semi-Shuffle-Pig Detector (SSPD) for PIR datasets. This novel approach ensures a less biased experimental output by maintaining the distinctiveness of testing data samples from the training datasets and systematically discarding superfluous information from raw images. Our optimized method significantly enhances the true performance of classification, providing unbiased experimental evaluations. Remarkably, our approach has led to a substantial improvement in the isolation after feeding (IAF) metric by 20.2% and achieved higher accuracy in segregating IAF and paired after feeding (PAF) classifications exceeding 92%. This methodology, therefore, ensures the preservation of pertinent data within the PIR system and eliminates potential biases in experimental evaluations. As a result, it enhances the accuracy and reliability of real-world PIR applications, contributing to improved animal welfare management, elevated food safety standards, and a more sustainable and climate-resilient livestock industry.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In recent decades, significant changes have driven the advancement of agricultural production systems in Brazil. The objective of this study is to analyze the efficiency and transformation of the agricultural production system in the <i>Ibirapuit&atilde;</i> Environmental Preservation Area (EPA) through nitrogen input and output flows. Methodologically, the approach is considered mixed, consisting of a case study and based on quantitative and qualitative techniques. Flowcharts and indicators were elaborated to evaluate nitrogen flows over time. The results were confirmed through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated that production based on economic efficiency is one of the main factors transforming the livestock system. The transformation of the production system into livestock did not reduce nitrogen flows. Productive and economic indicators reaffirm the transformation and volatility of livestock systems under economic and political contexts, even in an environmental protection unit.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The aging of the agricultural labor force is an irreversible trend that has become an important issue in China&rsquo;s economic transformation. Previous studies on the effects of an aging population in developing countries on agriculture mainly focused on food crops, and the conclusions were mixed. Using data for apple growers in Shaanxi Province, China, we used ordinary least squares (OLS), stochastic frontier production function (SFA), and truncated regression to investigate how rural aging affects apple production under different landform conditions. We provided evidence that (i) aging leads apple growers to use hired labor to replace family labor in the flatlands, but not in mountainous and hilly areas, due to landform constraints on the factor substitution; (ii) aging has no significant impact on mechanical inputs in either the plains or the mountains, indicating that machinery cannot effectively replace the labor force; (iii) limited by a shortage of labor quantity and quality, apple growers respond to aging by reducing agricultural inputs in mountainous and hilly areas; (iv) changes in input structure cause aging to have little influence on yield and technical efficiency in flatlands, while aging significantly reduces yield in mountainous and hilly areas; (v) there is a nonlinear relationship between aging and technical efficiency and yield; and (vi) because the overall mechanization level of China&rsquo;s apple industry is low, mechanical substitution for labor is not common in apple production.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Soil-cutting forces are key indicators of root-tuber harvesters and other soil-engaging tools&rsquo; performance. To improve operational efficiency, minimise soil disturbance, and reduce fuel consumption, the draught and vertical forces involved in root and tuber crop harvesting must be minimised. Two field experiments assessed the harvester&rsquo;s performance at a depth of 200 mm, varying frequencies, and travel speeds on clay and sandy loam soils. Discrete element models (DEM) were developed and subsequently used to replicate the field experiments and evaluate S-shaped and fork-shaped shovels. Linear regression and ANOVA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were used to analyse the data. Draught force concurrently increased with speed in both soil textures but decreased with vibration frequency. The draught force decreased by approximately 41% in clay soil and 21% in sandy loam soil when the harvester was operated between 5 Hz and 14.5 Hz and between 10 Hz and 12.5 Hz, respectively. DEM simulations had relative errors of 4% (clay) and 4.7% (sandy loam) for draught force and drawbar power compared to experimental data. The S-shaped shovel was more efficient at crushing and translocating soil&ndash;crop mass to the rear of the harvester than the fork-shaped shovel. These DEM soil&ndash;crop models are reliable for evaluating other root-tuber harvesting tools.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Vitamin E, consisting of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, with &alpha;-tocopherol as the most biologically active form, has a significant history in scientific research. It was first identified in the 1920s for its role in preventing neonatal mortality in rats. Over time, its chemical structure was elucidated, and its importance in the immune system, skin health, anti-inflammatory properties, and hormonal balance was revealed. Vitamin E production has evolved from natural sourcing to efficient synthesis with standardized potency units. Initially, animal studies focused on reproductive health and growth disorders, but later research highlighted vitamin E&rsquo;s role in preventing encephalomalacia in domestic fowl and muscular dystrophy in various animals. Today, vitamin E is commonly used as a feed additive to enhance animal health and immune function. Despite substantial knowledge about its role in animal nutrition, several questions remain unanswered. Current research seeks to determine optimal supplementation levels, interactions with other nutrients, impacts on gene expression, cell signaling, and communication, as well as the effects of high dosages in livestock. Vitamin E continues to be a crucial component in improving animal health, and ongoing research aims to uncover its benefits and mechanisms of action further.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The purpose of this paper is to summarize the available important information on local pig breeds maintained in Europe. Genetic erosion has prompted national and international bodies to take organized action aimed at the minimization of further losses of biodiversity. Since the genetic resources of livestock ensure both food security and the sustainable development of rural areas, genetic diversity is indispensable for sufficient flexibility of future animal husbandry to adapt to changing consumer demands and climatic conditions. Therefore, the problem of biodiversity has recently become an essential part of the comprehensive international program of the World Conservation Strategy and the global idea of the so-called sustainable development. The issue of biodiversity protection occupies an important place in the provisions of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. The successive financial perspectives assume an increase in relevant expenditure from the EU and national budgets. With regard to the protection of native pig breeds, a particularly large increase in funding was recorded in 2014&ndash;2020.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The increasing broiler demand due to overpopulation and meat imports presents challenges in poultry farming, including management, disease control, and chicken observation in varying light conditions. To address these issues, the development of AI-based management processes is crucial, especially considering the need for detecting pathological phenomena in intensive rearing. In this study, a dataset consisting of visual and thermal images was created to capture pathological phenomena in broilers. The dataset contains 10,000 images with 50,000 annotations labeled as lethargic chickens, slipped tendons, diseased eyes, stressed (beaks open), pendulous crop, and healthy broiler. Three versions of the YOLO-based algorithm (v8, v7, and v5) were assessed, utilizing augmented thermal and visual image datasets with various augmentation methods. The aim was to develop thermal- and visual-based models for detecting broilers in complex environments, and secondarily, to classify pathological phenomena under challenging lighting conditions. After training on acknowledged pathological phenomena, the thermal YOLOv8-based model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest accuracy in object detection (mAP50 of 0.988) and classification (F1 score of 0.972). This outstanding performance makes it a reliable tool for both broiler detection and pathological phenomena classification, attributed to the use of comprehensive datasets during training and development, enabling accurate and efficient detection even in complex environmental conditions. By employing both visual- and thermal-based models for monitoring, farmers can obtain results from both thermal and visual viewpoints, ultimately enhancing the overall reliability of the monitoring process.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Reusing water and nutrients from municipal wastewater can conserve resources and reduce wastewater treatment costs. In this study, the suitability of different qualities of treated wastewater for plant production in a hydroponic flow-through system was investigated. Lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i> L.) was grown in hydroponic lines fed with treated wastewater, i.e., conventional effluent from aerobic wastewater treatment by the activated sludge process (CE), ozonised CE (CEO), anaerobically pre-treated and nitrified wastewater (AN) and biological activated carbon filtered AN (ANC) in comparison with a modified Hoagland nutrient solution. In CEO, AN and ANC, the lettuce reached a similar weight and elemental composition as that in HS. The low N and P concentrations in CE and CEO were quickly depleted, resulting in limited plant development at the ends of these lines. The lower water content in the CE shoots was probably related to hypoxia that occurred at higher temperatures. In the CEO line, this condition did not arise due to the constant decay of O<sub>3</sub>. At lower temperatures, the CEO shoot dry weight was 90% higher than that in CE. This was possibly an effect of residual ozone and/or oxygen supersaturation. AN produced the highest yield, while carbon filtration lowered the content of cations in ANC, inducing deficiency of Fe &gt; Mn &gt; Cu &gt; Zn &gt; K. Coupling wastewater treatment with hydroponics allows for efficient nutrient recovery, and thus could reduce the energy and reactor volume needed for N and P elimination.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study aimed to investigate how the combination of texture information and spectral index affects the accuracy of the soil salinity inversion model. Taking the Bianwan Farm in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China as the research area, the multi-spectral data and soil salinity data at 0&ndash;15 cm, 15&ndash;30 cm and 30&ndash;50 cm depths in the sampling area under alfalfa coverage were collected, and spectral reflectance and texture features were obtained from a multispectral image. Moreover, the red-edge band was introduced to improve the spectral index, and gray correlation analysis was utilized to screen sensitive features. Five types of alfalfa-covered soil salinity machine learning inversion models based on random forest (RF) and extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms were constructed, using the salinity index (SIs), vegetation index (VIs), salinity index + vegetation index (SIs + VIs), vegetation index + texture feature (VIs + TFs), and vegetation index + texture index (VIs + TIs). The determination coefficient R<sup>2</sup>, root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate each model&rsquo;s performance. The results show that the VIs model is more accurate than the SIs and SIs +VIs models. Combining texture information with VIs improves the inversion accuracy, and the VIs + TIs model has the best inversion effect. From the perspective of inversion depth, the inversion effect for 0&ndash;15 cm soil salinity was significantly better than that for other depths, and was the best inversion depth under alfalfa cover. The average R<sup>2</sup> of the RF model was 10% higher than that of the ELM. The RF algorithm has high inversion accuracy and stability and performs better than ELM. These findings can serve as a theoretical basis for the efficient inversion of soil salinity and management of saline&ndash;alkali lands.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The best possible use of natural resources and the large amounts of trash produced by industrial and human activity is necessary for sustainable development. Due to the threat of global climate change and other environmental challenges, waste management systems are changing, leading to more instances of water resource management. The waste generated must be controlled from a sustainability point of view. Typically, the conventional disposal of Agricultural Wastewater (AW) and biomass can be achieved by recycling, reusing, and converting them into a variety of green products. To improve the AW quality for the purposes of environmental sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 and 14, dealing with clean water, sanitation, and life below water, are very important goals. Therefore, the present investigation evaluates the effectiveness of a Bench-scale Activated Sludge Reactor (BASR) system for AW treatment. The BASR was designed to focus on getting the maximum possible utilization out of a biosorbent derived from oil palm waste activated hydrochar (OPAH). This is in accordance with SDG 9, which targets inorganic and organic waste utilization for added value. An experiment was developed using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). A Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 1&ndash;3 days was used in the bioreactor&rsquo;s setup and operation, and Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) concentrations of 4000&ndash;6000 mg/L were used. BASR was fed with AW with initial mean concentrations of 4486 &plusmn; 5.63 mg/L and 6649 &plusmn; 3.48 for the five-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) experiments, respectively. The results obtained showed that maximum reductions of 84.66% and 72.07% were recorded for BOD<sub>5</sub> and COD, respectively. Through RSM optimization, the greatest reductions in the amounts of organic materials were achieved with a 2-day HRT and an MLSS dosage of 5000 mg/L. Substrate elimination thresholds were assessed using the first-order, the Grau second-order, and the modified Stover&ndash;Kincannon models. The reported observations were found to be perfectly fit by the modified Stover&ndash;Kincannon model, with high R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9908 and 0.9931 for BOD<sub>5</sub> and COD, respectively. As a result, the model may be used to design the BASR system and forecast how the reactor would behave. The findings from this study suggest that the developed OPAH has promising potential to be applied as eco-friendly material for the removal of BOD<sub>5</sub> and COD from AW. Consequently, the study findings additionally possess the ability to address SDGs 6, 9, and 14, in order to fulfil the United Nations (UN) goals through 2030.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Evaluating the effectiveness of fertilizers on crops without traditional yield is difficult, as clipping collection is time-consuming and not indicative of the desired response to the fertilizer. Remote sensing techniques, like the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have emerged as an effective tool to combat these issues. Canopy reflectance, measured by NDVI, is commonly used to differentiate turfgrass response to nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments; however, advancements in data processing are needed for greater differentiation between treatments and better testing of the effects of fertilizer responses. Presented here is an advancement in the processing of NDVI data by applying a compound exponential (pulse peak) function to changes in NDVI over time, relative to a control. This method&rsquo;s effectiveness in differentiating between fertilizers was evaluated by applying polymer-coated urea (PCU), an enhanced efficiency fertilizer (EEF), and urea on turfgrass to show the usefulness of the novel curve fitting in highlighting differences in fertilizer response. The field study was carried out on an established Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i> L.) blend on a sandy loam soil rootzone maintained with a typical home lawn maintenance regime. Ratios of PCU to urea ranging from 100% urea to 100% PCU with increments of 20% of PCU were used to observe a continuum of response between the two fertilizer types. The N rate for all blends was 73 kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>, with unfertilized plots used as a control to set baseline measurements for the curve fitting. Turfgrass response to N fertilization treatments was assessed through visual turfgrass quality ratings, dry matter yield, and canopy reflectance, where higher urea content resulted in the shortest time to maximum &#8710;NDVI (24 days), while 100% EEF reached maximum &#8710;NDVI at 56 days. The novel curve fitting analysis of the NDVI data allowed for differentiation between treatments, provided a measure of fertilizer effects, and differentiated between urea and enhanced efficiency fertilizers.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Gourmet mushrooms are foraged from the wild or grown indoors in controlled environments. Indoor mushroom farms with controlled growth environments allow for all-year-round growing. However, it remains a labor-intensive process. We propose MushR as a modular and scalable gourmet mushroom growing and harvesting system that goes beyond the state of the art, which merely monitors and controls the growing environment, by introducing an image recognition system that determines when and which mushrooms are ready to be harvested in conjunction with a proof of concept of an automated mushroom harvesting mechanism for harvesting the mushrooms without human interaction. The image recognition setup monitors the growing status of the mushrooms and guides the harvesting process. We present a Mask R-CNN model for the detection of oyster mushroom maturity with a 91.7% training accuracy and a semiautomated harvesting system, integrating a Raspberry Pi for control, an electrical switch, an air compressor, and a pneumatic cylinder with a cutting knife to facilitate timely mushroom harvesting. The modularity and scalability of the system allow for industry-level usage and can be scaled according to the required mushroom-growing systems within the facility. The AI model, its underlying dataset, a digital twin for mushroom production, the setup of our growth and control chambers, and additional information are all made available under an open-source license.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The use of amaranth green mass as an alternative source of protein and fiber for canned feed for ruminants is very promising because of several reasons, including a high concentration of crude protein and dry matter digestibility, lower water requirement compared to corn, and a high yield. The purpose of this work is to develop a silage starter from lactic acid bacteria and study its effect on the quality of fermentation and the chemical composition of the silage. The selection of strains of lactic acid bacteria in the composition of the starter was carried out, taking into account their antibacterial activity against opportunistic microorganisms <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Amaranth was treated with the developed silage starter (MPF) before ensiling. The study of the composition of the microflora and the acidity of the silage was carried out periodically during the amaranth ensiling process and after 45 days of storage. The use of MPF starter provided a rapid decrease in pH and, on the 10th day, reached a value of 4.2. Silage with the use of MPF starter was characterized by the largest amount of lactic acid&mdash;75.1%, the lowest content of acetic acid&mdash;24.9%, and the absence of butyric acid. The use of the MPF starter compared to other treatments resulted in the retention of crude protein up to 90%, which improved the quality of amaranth silage. Amaranth silage, in comparison with corn silage traditionally used in fodder production, was characterized by an increased content of all essential amino acids; in terms of lysine content, it exceeded corn silage 2.5 times. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the developed silage starter can significantly improve the quality of amaranth silage.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The pose of cows reflects their body condition, and the information contained in the skeleton can provide data support for lameness, estrus, milk yield, and contraction behavior detection. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically detecting the condition of cows in a real farm environment based on skeleton spatio-temporal features. The cow skeleton is obtained by matching Partial Confidence Maps (PCMs) and Partial Affinity Fields (PAFs). The effectiveness of skeleton extraction was validated by testing 780 images for three different poses (standing, walking, and lying). The results indicate that the Average Precision of Keypoints (APK) for the pelvis is highest in the standing and lying poses, achieving 89.52% and 90.13%, respectively. For walking, the highest APK for the legs was 88.52%, while the back APK was the lowest across all poses. To estimate the pose, a Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) was constructed, and comparative experiments were conducted to compare different attention mechanisms and activation functions. Among the tested models, the CMS-TCN with Coord Attention and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation functions achieved precision, recall, and F1 scores of 94.71%, 86.99%, and 90.69%, respectively. This method demonstrates a relatively high detection rate, making it a valuable reference for animal pose estimation in precision livestock farming.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The objective of this study was to obtain different dry matter contents and proportions of melon plant biomass for silage making. A completely randomized design with factorial arrangement (3 &times; 2) and four replications was adopted. The first factor consisted of three melon biomass mixtures based on as-fed composition of plant (branches + leaves) and harvested melon (fruits)&mdash;100% plant (0% fruit), 90% plant + 10% fruit, and 100% fruit. The second factor corresponded to the ensiled material, which was either fresh or dehydrated in the field after harvest (40% dry matter). Silages produced from dehydrated biomass after fruit harvest, containing 0% and 10% fruit, showed the highest dry matter contents: 297 g/kg and 293 g/kg, respectively. Silages produced from fresh biomass containing 0% and 10% fruit showed high concentrations of acetic acid, reaching 14.9 g/kg and 14.1 g/kg, respectively. Silages produced from dehydrated biomass containing 10% and 100% fruit showed better results in terms of the indicators associated with high-quality silage. Dehydration improves the fermentative profile and overall quality of melon silage.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Maintaining the plant architecture of <i>Psidium guajava</i> L. (guava tree) is essential for enhancing capture and distribution in the plant, directly affecting the fruit quality. The lifespan of the harvest period can be extended by proper pruning. Both timeliness and proper pruning play crucial roles in achieving high-quality fruit production and in maintaining a consistent fruit size while stimulating ascorbic acid levels, sugar content, total soluble solids (TSS), and titratable acidity. From this perspective, this study aimed to characterize the influence of different intensities of fruit pruning and thinning on guava trees grown under a seasonal tropical climate in two growing seasons in Currais, Piau&iacute;, Brazil. The experiment was set up in a randomized block design with a 3 &times; 3 &times; 2 factorial arrangement corresponding to short, medium, and long pruning intensities and 0%, 10%, and 20% thinning intensities during the two growth seasons, respectively. An analysis was performed to discriminate the treatment groups according to the physicochemical variables of the guava tree cv. Paluma and canonical discriminant analysis. There was significant variation in the SS, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH contents. Cluster analysis of all treatments allowed division into five different groups for the two pruning times. Canonical discriminant analysis showed that the first two canonical variables explained 91% of the total variance. The fruits of the second harvest exhibited a lower level of acidity, higher levels of soluble solids, and higher levels of ascorbic acid contents. In addition, these fruits also obtained better nutrient contents. Short pruning with up to 20% thinning, medium pruning with up to 10%, and long pruning without thinning favored better levels of macronutrients and micronutrients and, consequently, better fruit quality. Medium or long pruning with up to 20% thinning resulted in higher average fruit weights and nutrient contents (especially of Fe and Cu), lower acidity, and higher ascorbic acid contents. Thus, in general, the importance of production pruning in guava plants is evidenced and thinning of 20% is recommended to improve the fruit quality.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Maize is an important crop to ensure food safety. High-quality seeds can guarantee a good yield. The maize seed germination rate is the most important information for the maize industry, which can be obtained through the seed germination test. An essential stage in determining the germination rate is the planting of the seeds. The current seed planting process is fully manual, which is labor-intensive and costly, and it requires the development of an autonomous seeding machine. This research developed an automatic maize seeding machine, consisting of four operations: paving sand, seed layout, watering, and covering the seed. Among the four procedures, sand paving is a crucial step, the performance of which is affected by the gate opening size, conveyor speed, and sensor mounting location. Three performance evaluating factors are the weight of sand in the tray, the volume of sand left on the conveyor, and sand surface flatness. A full factorial experiment was designed with three variables and three levels to determine an appropriate factor combination. RGB-D information was used to calculate the volume of sand left on the conveyor and sand flatness. An analytic hierarchy process was employed to assign weights to the three evaluation indicators and score the various combinations of factors. The machine for paving sand achieved a satisfactory result with an opening size of 10.8 mm, a sensor distance of 9 cm, and a conveyor belt speed of 5.1 cm/s. With the most satisfactory factors determined, the machine shows superior performance to better meet practical applications.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Crop production constitutes a significant portion of the EU&rsquo;s agricultural output and influences land use decisions. Various elements within the crop production system can significantly impact its outcomes. This paper aims to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of crop rotation, catch crops, and different tillage practices in Latvia by analyzing data from case studies, field trials, and field monitoring to identify the potential for improvement towards a more sustainable utilization of agricultural land. Environmental performance was evaluated by focusing on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), as it is likely to play a significant role in assessing the environmental suitability of crop production according to the Platform on Sustainable Finance. For economic performance, gross margins were calculated. Crop rotation in Latvia tends to be monotonous, with wheat and oilseed rape dominating over 60% of the cultivated area due to their profitability. The findings of this study indicate that achieving a minimum NUE of 70% is challenging. Crop rotations including oilseed rape, particularly the common wheat&ndash;oilseed rape rotation, have an average NUE below the threshold, while proper use of catch crops may increase NUE by 7&ndash;9%. The three-year field trials on commercial farms yielded divergent findings about the impact of various tillage practices on NUE and gross margin. However, the field trials conducted on the farm practicing reduced tillage for over ten years show higher NUE compared to ploughing. The advantage of reduced tillage was supported by the obtained results indicating lower costs of agrotechnical operations, including less diesel consumption.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>There has been an excitement toward novel eco-friendly alternatives to pest management, particularly formulations based on essential oils (EOs). Here, the biological activity of an EO-based emulsion derived from patchouli, <i>Pogostemon cablin,</i> was assessed against <i>Tuta absoluta</i> (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a devastating and invasive pest in tomato crops worldwide. Laboratory bioassays were carried out to determine and compare lethal doses, lethal times, oviposition of treated individuals, and oviposition of <i>T. absoluta</i> on treated leaves of tomato to pure patchouli essential oil or its emulsion containing 18% of oil. The LD50 were 10.06 and 2.57 &micro;g of patchouli per mg of insect for the EO and emulsion, respectively. Oviposition was reduced in adults derived from the second instar treated with LD<sub>10</sub> by 78.5% (EO) and 85.4% (emulsion). The EO and its emulsion conferred similar avoidance to adults when sprayed on tomato leaves. Therefore, both formulations present similar lethal and sublethal effects against <i>T</i>. <i>absoluta</i>. This study demonstrated a remarkable potential of an emulsion containing 18% of <i>P. cablin</i> oil to be employed for <i>T</i>. <i>absoluta</i> management on tomato crops. Further studies are needed to assess and guarantee open field applications.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>(1) Locusts are important agricultural pests. Identifying harmful substances and avoiding them is important for locusts&rsquo; survival; their abilities to do so remain to be clarified. (2) We examined the electrophysiological (electroantennogram (EAG) and single sensillum recording (SSR)) and behavioral responses (preference behavior in a T-maze) of locusts to 18 different compounds; (3) Of these 18 compounds, 9 elicited strong EAG responses, and 3 elicited SSR responses of neurons expressing locust odorant receptor 3 (<i>Lmig</i>OR3). The 11 chemicals that elicited stronger EAG or SSR responses were selected for evaluation of the behavioral responses of locusts. Only 2-heptanone induced significant attraction responses in locusts at the tested concentration. RNA interference (RNAi) of <i>Lmig</i>OR3 and SSR experiments revealed that <i>Lmig</i>OR3 could detect 2-heptanone and 3-octanone. However, in behavioral experiments, RNAi of <i>Lmig</i>OR3 did not alter 2-heptanone-induced attraction but increased attraction by 3-octanone. (4) Our results suggest that the broadly tuned receptor expressed in a heterologous expression system exhibits a narrow electrophysiological response spectrum, and the aversive response of locusts to 3-octanone, an odorant from fungal pathogens, natural enemies, and non-host plants, is mediated by <i>Lmig</i>OR3. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex olfactory recognition mechanism in insects.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Soil fertility plays a crucial role in crop growth, so it is important to study the spatial distribution and variation of soil fertility for agricultural management and decision-making. However, traditional methods for assessing soil fertility are time-consuming and economically burdensome. Moreover, it is hard to capture the spatial variation of soil properties across continuous geographic space using the conventional methods. As key techniques of digital soil mapping (DSM), spatial interpolation techniques have been widely applied in soil surveys and analysis in recent years, since they can predict soil properties at unknown points in continuous space based on limited sample points. However, further research is needed on spatial interpolation models for DSM in regions with variable climates and complex terrains, which are characterized by strong spatial variation in both environmental variables and soil fertility. In this study, taking a typical hilly area in a subtropical monsoon climate, i.e., Gaozhou, Guangdong Province, China, as an example, the performances of four popular spatial interpolation models (Random Forest (RF), Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Radial Basis Function) for digital soil mapping on available phosphorus (AP) are compared. Based on RF, the spatial variation and its driving factors of the AP of Gaozhou are then analyzed. Furthermore, by selecting three typical truncation lines from different directions, the correlations between environmental variables and AP in different spatial positions are demonstrated. The root mean square error (RMSE) results of the above four models are 32.01, 32.08, 32.74, and 33.08, respectively, which indicate that the RF has a higher interpolation accuracy. Based on the mapping results of RF, the minimum, maximum, and mean values of AP in the study area are 38.90, 95.24, and 64.96 mg/kg, respectively. The high-value areas of AP are mainly distributed in forested and orchard areas, while the low-value areas are primarily found in urban and cultivated areas in the eastern and western regions. Vegetation and topography are identified as the key factors shaping the spatial variations of AP in the study area. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of the influence strength of altitude and EVI is revealed, providing a new direction for further research on DSM in the future, i.e., spatial interpolation models considering the spatial heterogeneity of the influence of environmental variables.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Natural extracts of <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry due to their antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and antidepressant activities. Plant biotechnological methods are gaining more attention as efficient and biosustainable approaches for the production of high value compounds by using plant callus cultures in vitro. The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of phytohormones on the formation of <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. callus culture, to explore antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and to determine the amounts of phytochemicals in the analyzed extracts. Callus cultures were induced on Murashige and Skoog basal medium supplemented with phytohormones (auxins, cytokinins, and salicylic acid), and containing newly synthesized compound <i>N</i>-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)-3-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)propanamide. The antioxidant activities of callus cultures were evaluated using DPPH and FRAP assays and the enzyme antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase) were evaluated. The antibacterial activity of plant extracts was screened against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> bacteria by the diffusion agar method. There was a significant positive correlation between total phenolic content and high antioxidant efficiency in <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. callus cultures, which were formed on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with auxin, cytokinin, and salicylic acid (100 &micro;M). Our results have demonstrated that callus cultures generated on MS medium supplemented with <i>N</i>-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)-3-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)propanamide and cytokinin BAP (0.5 mg L<sup>&minus;1</sup>) exhibited improved antioxidant activities for the first time.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Objective:</i> Stakeholders&mdash;farmers from four different European areas (Campania (IT), Kujawsko-Pomorskie (PL), Limburg (NL), Andalusia (ES))&mdash;are asked to share, from the OPERA project, their opinions on five criteria that all aim at improving the use of irrigation advisory services (IASs). Each criterion has different characteristics that affect the way farmers rank it. The present study has two objectives. The first is to individuate the priorities of the preferences expressed by the stakeholders. The second objective is to carry out a ranking of the weights of the criteria by case study, ranking the groups and their associated properties among farmers&rsquo; profiles. <i>Methods</i>: The answers to 120 questionnaires dispensed to the future users of IASs in the four agricultural sites were analyzed in detail, and then the given priorities were evaluated through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP methodology was used to determine the relative weights of the five assessment criteria, and finally, to select the one with major value. <i>Results and conclusions</i>: The results show that A5 (assuring economic sustainability) was the most important criterion. The contributions provided by this study are twofold: Firstly, it presents an application of a methodology that involves the conversion of a linguistic judgement of farmers in a correspondence weight. Secondly, it tackles decision making regarding improving the use of IASs, evaluating the preferences expressed by the stakeholders. Irrigation advisory services can play a key role in assisting users to adopt new techniques and technologies for more efficient water use and increased production.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The scope of this study is the evaluation of early detection methods for cavitation phenomena in centrifugal irrigation pumps by analyzing the produced vibration and sound signals from a low-cost sensor and data acquisition system and comparing several computational methods. Vibration data was acquired using the embedded accelerometer sensor of a smartphone device. Sound signals were obtained using the embedded microphone of the same commercial smartphone. The analysis was based on comparing the signals in different operating conditions with reference to the best efficiency operating point of the pump. In the case of vibrations, data was acquired for all three directional axes. The signals were processed by computational methods to extract the relative features in the frequency domain and use them to train an artificial neural network to be able to identify the different pump operating conditions while the cavitation phenomenon evolves. Three different classification algorithms were used to examine the most preferable approach for classifying data, namely the Classification Tree, the K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Support Vector Data algorithms. In addition, a convolutional neural network was utilized to examine the success rate of the classification when the datasets were formed as spectrograms instead. A detailed comparison of the classification algorithms and different axes was conducted. Comparing the results of the different methods for vibration and sound datasets, classification accuracy showed that in the case of vibration, the detection of cavitation in real conditions is possible, while it proves more challenging to identify cavitation conditions using sound data obtained with low-cost commercial sensors.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Tractors transporting heavy hitches tend to tilt severely, resulting in significant dynamic loads on the front axle and affecting handling stability. Tractors and rear hitches can be considered vibration systems with two coupled masses. Thus, active damping control strategies between tractors and rear hitches are proposed in this study. The complexity and versatility of tractor hydraulic hitching during tractor transit transport are considered. A method of improving the tractor hydraulic hitch damping ratio with pressure feedback is proposed. The dynamic characteristics of the pressure feedback hydraulic hitch system are analyzed. A dynamic model of the tractor transfer transport unit is established, and a numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hydraulic hitch vibration reduction control strategy based on pressure feedback. A real test platform for tractor vibration reduction control is built. The test results show that the pressure feedback vibration reduction control method proposed in this paper affects tractor pitching motion suppression. In addition, the proposed control strategy does not require a force pin sensor. Tractor hydraulic hitch damping control costs are reduced. The vibration reduction control strategy proposed in this study has high reliability and can be used as a reference for non-road-vehicle vibration reduction control.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Siraitia grosvenorii</i>, a medicinal plant with continuous cropping, is cultivated in southern China. Changes in the soil microbial community during continuous cropping can cause soil-borne diseases in <i>S. grosvenorii</i>. This experimental study aimed to determine the differences in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community structure and root colonization in the rhizosphere soil of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> with different continuous cropping years and altitudes. We tested three altitude gradients (low, 200&ndash;300 m; middle, 500&ndash;600 m; and high, 700&ndash;800 m) and four continuous cropping years (1, 2, 3, and 5 years). AMF colonization, along with AMF spore density, and the soil physicochemical properties of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> roots at different altitudes and continuous cropping years were determined. Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the molecular diversity of AMF in the rhizosphere of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> as they exhibited a symbiotic relationship. The AMF species in the rhizosphere soil of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> included 28 species of nine genera, including <i>Glomus</i>, <i>Claroideoglomus</i>, <i>Acaulospora</i>, <i>Paraglomus,&nbsp;Ambispora</i>, and so on. With an increasing altitude, the AMF colonization of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> roots increased significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01); available phosphorus (AP) content was negatively correlated with AMF colonization (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). <i>Glomus</i> and <i>Paraglomus</i> were the common dominant genera in the rhizosphere soil of <i>S. grosvenorii</i> planted for 2&ndash;5 years at a low altitude and 1 year at middle and high altitudes. The average relative abundance of <i>Glomus</i> increased with increasing continuous cropping years and altitude in the low-altitude and 1-year <i>S. grosvenorii</i> areas, respectively. Slightly acidic rhizosphere soil contributed to AMF colonization and improved the richness and diversity of the AMF community. Our results showed that altitude, AP, and pH are essential factors for predicting AMF infection and community changes in the <i>S. grosvenorii</i> rhizosphere. Here, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to study the species resources and community composition of mycorrhizal fungi in <i>S. grosvenorii</i> in the hilly areas of Guangxi, China. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application and practice of mycorrhizal fungi including the isolation and screening of dominant strains, inoculation of mycorrhizal fungi, and exploration of the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the growth and active ingredients of medicinal plants.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Cyperus esculentus</i> is considered the sixteenth worst weed in the world. The weed causes huge losses in arable crops. Current control strategies are based on combinations of chemical and mechanical methods, repeated over years, and aim to deplete the belowground bud bank. However, this is a slow process. Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) using readily decomposable carbon sources may be a promising innovative method to quickly deplete the bud bank. This study investigated the effect of ASD with fresh grass clippings (dosage of 80 tonnes ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) differing in C:N ratio and Herbie<sup>&reg;</sup> (consists of organic by-products from the food processing industry, dosage of 25 tonnes ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) on the vitality of small and large <i>C. esculentus</i> tubers buried at three depths (5, 15, and 30 cm) into two soils differing in soil type and soil moisture content. Their effects were compared with the effect of chemical soil disinfestation (CSD) with metam-sodium (153 kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>). ASD with Herbie<sup>&reg;</sup> showed at least equal performance compared with CSD with metam-sodium, with reductions in tuber vitality up to 97.5%. The performance of ASD with grass clippings was less consistent across soils and was affected by the C:N ratio of the grass. Both ASD and CSD showed the highest performance in moist, sandy soil and on small tubers. ASD is an effective and promising method to quickly deplete the <i>C. esculentus</i> bud bank, provided that the soil is sandy and moist, the carbon source has a C:N ratio of about 10, and the incorporation depth is at least 25 cm. To foster the implementation of ASD, future research should evaluate its performance consistency across environments and years.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Early diagnosis of rice disease is important because it poses a considerable threat to agricultural productivity as well as the global food security of the world. It is challenging to obtain more reliable outcomes based on the percentage of RGB value using image processing outcomes for rice disease detections and classifications in the agricultural field. Machine learning, especially with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is a great tool to overcome this problem. But the utilization of deep learning techniques often necessitates high-performance computing devices, costly GPUs and extensive machine infrastructure. As a result, this significantly raises the overall expenses for users. Therefore, the demand for smaller CNN models becomes particularly pronounced, especially in embedded systems, robotics and mobile applications. These domains require real-time performance and minimal computational overhead, making smaller CNN models highly desirable due to their lower computational cost. This paper introduces a novel CNN architecture which is comparatively small in size and promising in performance to predict rice leaf disease with moderate accuracy and lower time complexity. The CNN network is trained with processed images. The image processing is performed using segmentation and k-means clustering to remove background and green parts of affected images. This technique proposes to detect rice disease of rice brown spot, rice bacterial blight and leaf smut with reliable outcomes in disease classifications. The model is trained using an augmented dataset of 2700 images (60% data) and validated with 1200 images of disease-affected samples to identify rice disease in agricultural fields. The model is tested with 630 images (14% data); testing accuracy is 97.9%. The model is exported into a mobile application to introduce the real-life application of the outcome of this work. The model accuracy is compared to others work associated with this type of problem. It is found that the performance of the model and the application are satisfactory compared to other works related to this work. The over-all accuracy is notable, showing the reliability and dependability of this model to classify rice leaf diseases.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Improving the operating income of farmers and herdsmen is an important starting point for achieving common prosperity. As a common form of learning and an important source of skills training, informal learning has a certain impact on the economy and income level of farmers and herdsmen. This paper takes 439 herdsmen in three cities of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the research object and tries to explore the comprehensive influence, subdivision difference, and mechanism of informal learning on the operating income of herdsmen on the theoretical and empirical levels. The results show that the impact of informal learning on the operating income of herdsmen is &ldquo;inverted U-shaped&rdquo;, and there is an informal learning balance point of 2.9776 h, which maximizes the effect of informal learning on the increased operating income of herdsmen. After using the instrumental variable method to deal with endogeneity and conducting robustness tests through winsorizing, quantile regression, and substitution variables, the research conclusions were still valid. Heterogeneity analysis found that informal learning has a significant impact on the increase in operating income of herdsmen in the low human capital group, reflecting the role of &ldquo;sending charcoal in the snow&rdquo;. However, it has no significant effect on the increase in operating income of herdsmen in the high human capital group, and the effect of &ldquo;icing on the cake&rdquo; is not obvious. In view of this result, government departments should speed up the planning of Internet infrastructure construction in pastoral areas, and accurately push the knowledge and skills needs of herdsmen to help increase the operating income of herdsmen.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The limited scion-rootstock combinations used in sweet orange orchards in Brazil reduce the commercial potential of citrus and lead to greater susceptibility to pests and diseases. Aiming to provide germplasm diversification, the research evaluated the Folha Murcha (FM) and Charmute de Brotas (CB) orange trees grafted onto &lsquo;Rangpur&rsquo; lime (RL) and &lsquo;Swingle&rsquo; citrumelo (SC) rootstocks. The study was conducted in the southern center of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, in the subtropical region of southeastern Brazil. The grafted trees were planted in September 2016. The field experiment was conducted over two seasons. The combinations were evaluated based on the duration in days and degree-days of the phenological intervals, growth and yield performance, alternate bearing, fruit ripening, and quality. The trees of the two scion cultivars grafted onto RL had the shortest crop cycle, the earliest fruit ripening, and the largest canopy volume. SC produced fewer alternate bearings with greater production efficiency. The CB/SC combination produced fruits with a better color index, higher total soluble solids content, and a higher technological index. This assessment can be useful in planning orchards for dual-purpose markets, such as table fruit and the juice industry.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Cotton gin trash (CGT) is composed of fibre residues, leaves, dust particles, soil, and other materials derived during the ginning and yarn-spinning process in processing industries. In the cotton-spinning industrial clusters, farmers are using CGT as one of the alternative roughage feeds for their sheep, mainly during forage shortages in the summer months. Baseline information on farmers using gin and the factors driving them to choose CGT as a roughage source needs to be identified for future planning regarding the usage of CGT in sheep feeding. Considering the above facts, the present study was undertaken to assess the socio-personal characteristics and managemental practices associated with farmers using cotton gin in the feeding of sheep; also, it was conducted to identify the factors driving the choice of the CGT as the primary source of roughage in the cotton-spinning industry cluster of Tamil Nadu, India. For this, a survey among 80 sheep farmers was carried out using a pre-tested interview schedule. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logit regression. The results indicated that the majority of male, aged, and large-land farmers were involved in practicing CGT feeding during the summer and also indicated the non-availability of green fodder during the same period of time. The coarse type of CGT is preferred over the fine type of CGT trash in that area due to quality perception and price. The replacement level of CGT as roughage ranged from 33 to 75% of the total roughage requirement per day. About 88% of farmers were highly satisfied with the results of using CGT and they also expressed that the presence of foreign particles and dust was the major problem with using CGT. The choice of CGT as primary roughage among sheep farmers was primarily influenced by selective farming contexts, namely, landholding, access to labour, and the feeding practices of other livestock with cotton gin. Furthermore, research needs to be focused on improving the quality of CGT in the future as it is being utilised largely by sheep farmers.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Since the banning of antibiotics in animal feeds (2006), there has been an increase in the number of studies looking for alternatives to stimulate the gut immune system. The main objective of our review article is to underline the nutraceutical properties of <i>Curcuma longa</i> and <i>Spirulina platensis</i> in the broiler chicken industry, and the experimental data were obtained by analyzing literature sources. <i>Spirulina platensis</i> is widely recognized as a valuable protein source, containing approximately 55&ndash;70% protein, 25% carbohydrates, essential amino acids, and 18% fatty acids. It is also rich in various vitamins like thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, vitamin C, gamma-linolenic acid, phycocyanins, tocopherols, chlorophyll, beta-carotenes, carotenoids, exhibiting positive effects on growth performance, gut integrity, and immunity. The anti-inflammatory effect of spirulina supplementation at different levels showed a decrease in caspase-3 and the TNF-&alpha; immunolabeling index; a reduction in IL-1&beta;, IL-2 and IFN-&gamma;; and an increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. Spirulina inhibits the synthesis of cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-gamma in addition to the activities of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzymes. Turmeric also positively influences the growth, egg production, and overall health of chickens. Curcumin, the most potent component of turmeric, possesses additional pharmacological activities, including hepatoprotective, immunostimulant, and anticancer effects. Its immunomodulatory properties greatly enhance the immune system response, acting as a natural antibiotic against pathogens and decreasing levels of proinflammatory interleukins IL-1&beta;, IL-6, IL-2, IL-18, and TNF-&alpha;.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Most of the approximately 105 million Egyptians depend on wheat in the form of <i>baladi</i> bread for their daily diet. Millions of smallholders along the River Nile have produced wheat for millennia; however, in more recent history, the wheat demand and supply ratio has dramatically changed. The first wheat imports in Egyptian history were in 1966. Today, domestic production meets only half of the wheat consumption, and Egypt has become the largest wheat importer in the world. Before the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, 85% of the wheat imports to Egypt came from Russia and Ukraine. The war and the associated disruption of the wheat supply chains has put Egypt on the top list of so-called &ldquo;developing countries highly threatened by food crises&rdquo;. Against this backdrop, we analyzed decision-making factors and perceptions of wheat-producing smallholders in the Nile River Delta, the wheat basket of Egypt. The study draws on nine months of empirical fieldwork in the Nile River Delta. We employed a mixed approach to data collection, combining interviews and focus group discussions with smallholders, experts, and agriculture extension agents with transect walks and field observations. In total, 246 randomly selected wheat-growing smallholders were interviewed in four divisions in the Nile River Delta. Our findings show that the production of wheat by smallholders is highly influenced by system-immanent factors, such as subsistence need for home consumption and the presence and intensity of animal husbandry, as well as by external factors, such as the domestic prices for wheat determined by the government in each season and the time of the declaration of these prices. These factors affect smallholders&rsquo; decisions to increase or decrease their wheat cultivation area. However, the study also showed that the factors influencing farmers&rsquo; decisions to grow wheat or implement innovative practices vary across different areas within the same region. Smallholders struggle with poor access to fundamental production factors and are discontented with the low provision of extension and support services as well as poor market structures. These constraints act as disincentives for smallholders to produce (more) wheat. They need to be addressed and eliminated to increase domestic production and to reduce Egypt&rsquo;s dependency on expensive and unreliable wheat imports.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The tractor is the primary power device of the agricultural production process. For the problem that the traditional electro-hydraulic hitch control method for tractors cannot simultaneously meet the requirements of maintaining a constant ploughing depth and improving traction performance and electric tractor overall efficiency, this paper proposes a hydraulic cylinder pressure control method of the electro-hydraulic hitch system for electric tractors. We establish a tractor-implement system dynamic model, calculate the rear axle load of the tractor in real-time according to the actual working parameters under the premise of ensuring the constant ploughing depth, construct a traction performance objective optimization function, and use the genetic algorithm to solve the optimal hydraulic cylinder pressure value of the electro-hydraulic hitch system. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results show that the electric tractor under the traditional position control method and the hydraulic cylinder pressure control method has an average wheel slip of 18.50% and 16.93%, an average traction efficiency of 71.35% and 73.08%, and an average overall efficiency of 50.81% and 52.40%. The hydraulic cylinder pressure control method proposed in this paper reduces the wheel slip by 9.27%, increases the traction efficiency by 2.42%, improves the electric tractor overall efficiency by 3.13%, and reduces the electric tractor overall energy loss by 7.67% compared with the traditional position-control method. Therefore, the hydraulic cylinder pressure control method of the electro-hydraulic hitch system proposed in this paper can achieve the purpose of effectively improving tractor traction performance and reducing tractor energy loss while maintaining a constant ploughing depth. This study offers technological references for electric tractors to improve traction performance and reduce the overall energy loss of electric tractors.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of tillage type (i.e., primary and secondary tillage) and gear selection (P1L2 to P1L4) on the working load of tractor&ndash;implement systems during rotary tillage. Soil properties change with depth, and differences in properties along the depth distribution, such as the location of formation of the hardpan layer, internal friction angle, and moisture content, affect the load of rotary tillage operations. Therefore, the physical properties of soil along the field depth distribution were measured to analyze the effect of tillage type and gear selection on workload in rotary tillage. In addition, a load measurement system equipped with PTO torque meter, axle torque meter, proximity sensor, and RTK-GPS were configured on the 42 kW agricultural tractor. The experimental results show that the combination of tillage type and gear selection has a wide-ranging effect on the tractor&rsquo;s workload and performance when the rotavator operated at the same tilling depth. Overall working load was higher by up to 14% (engine) and 29.1% (PTO shaft) in primary tillage compared to secondary tillage when the gear selection was the same. When the tillage type is the same, it was analyzed that the overall average torque increased by up to 35.9% (engine) and 33.9% (PTO shaft) in P1L4 compared to P1L2 according to gear selection. Based on load analysis results, it was found that the effect of gear selection (Engine: 4&ndash;14%, PTO: 12.1&ndash;28.6%) on engine and PTO loads was higher than that of tillage type (Engine: 31.6&ndash;35.1%, PTO: 31.9&ndash;32.8%), and the power requirement tended to decrease in secondary tillage. Therefore, working load should be considered according to the soil environment and tillage type when designing agricultural machinery system.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Treated bio-residues can be used as biostimulants in crops within the circular economy approach to reduce the use of traditional fertilisers. In this work, we optimised the combination rates for three types of treated bio-residues (compost, biochar, and anaerobic digestate (AD)) in two microcosm trials, one with a combination of compost and biochar and other with biochar and AD. The crop used was maize, and the variables analysed were plant growth, and soil chemical and biological properties. The combination of bio-residues improved plant growth and soil biological activity to a greater extent than one product alone; that is, compost and biochar performed better than compost alone and biochar, and AD performed better than biochar alone. However, while the concentration in the plant biomass of several essential nutrients for crops increased in the treatments with compost and biochar, and with biochar and AD, compared to the untreated controls, the nitrogen concentration was reduced. This was due to the competition for nitrogen between the plant and the soil microbiome, whose activity was activated. Due to the importance of nitrogen in plant growth, the increase in biomass production could be explained not only by the higher availability of other nutrients but also by the plant-growth-promoting activity exerted by the more active soil microbiome. Further research should focus on validating this hypothesis and unravelling the mechanisms involved. From the environmental site, the presence of biochar in the mixtures of organic residues reduced the soil nitrogen at risk of lixiviation and sequestered carbon, which partially compensated for the increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions because labile forms of carbon were present in the remaining organic residues.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Every year, the global food industry produces a significant number of wastes and by-products from a variety of sources. By-products from the food-processing sector are produced in large quantities, and because of their undesirable qualities, they are frequently wasted, losing important resources. In order to pursue a circular economy that refers to waste reduction and effective waste management, by-products valorization recently received increased interest. By-products are rich in bioactive compounds and can be used in various industrial applications for health promotion and nutritional benefits. A novel step in its sustainable application is the use of these inexpensive waste agri-food by-products to create the value-added products. The present review intended to summarize the different types of agro-industrial by-products and their properties and highlight their nutritional composition and potential health benefits. Applications of agri-food by-products in foods as well as the potential health and sustainability implications of by-products in food products were also covered. According to research, agri-food by-products can be added to a variety of food to increase their bioactive profile, fiber content, and antioxidant capacity while maintaining good sensory acceptability. Overall, the sustainability of the agri-food chain and consumer health can both benefit from the use of agri-food by-products in food formulation.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Powdery mildew is a prevalent disease that affects cucumber crops, leading to yield reductions and declines in quality. <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain Tcb43 culture medium was shown to be capable of inhibiting fungal spore germination in previous reports. In this study, the identification of the Tcb43 strain was updated to <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> by using whole-genome sequencing. The strain exhibited tolerance to a wide range of temperatures (12&ndash;40 &deg;C), salinities (7&ndash;10%), and pH levels (ranging from 5 to 11). Additionally, Tcb43 demonstrated insensitivity to most tested fungicides. A new fermentation formula, Tcb43FBSO, was developed by adding 0.25% soybean oil to the fermented formula (Tcb43FB). This new formula exhibited a shelf life of up to 12 months with the decrease in bacterial count from 5.35 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> to 1.97 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL. Greenhouse assays showed that the treatment of potted cucumber plants with a 100-fold dilution (100&times;) of Tcb43FBSO for four weeks resulted in a significant reduction (64.64%) of cucumber powdery mildew compared to the mock group. In large-scale greenhouse trials, the treatment of cucumber plants with 200&times; of Tcb43FBSO for 5 weeks effectively suppressed powdery mildew disease, with a control rate that reached 76.6% compared to the mock group. These findings highlight the potential of Tcb43 as a biocontrol agent for managing cucumber powdery mildew and suggest its promising application in agriculture.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The shitake mushroom (<i>lentinula edodes</i>) industry in the Gobi Desert region of southern Xinjiang has experienced rapid development and has reached a certain scale. To clarify the laws governing different cooling methods in greenhouses and identify suitable cooling methods for mushroom production in the Gobi Desert region, this study focused on monitoring the environmental changes in greenhouses using three different cooling methods: natural ventilation cooling, water-sprinkling roof cooling, and a fan and pad cooling system. The results showed that when combined with external shading (shade netting), natural ventilation cooling, fan and pad cooling, and water-sprinkling roof cooling, respectively, reduced the air temperature by 8.6 &deg;C, 14.0 &deg;C, and 15.2 &deg;C. They also increased the relative humidity by 15.3%, 43.3%, and 51.2%, resulting in cooling efficiencies of 28.5%, 56.3%, and 68.1%, respectively. The water-sprinkling roof cooling system demonstrated the best cooling effect and temperature uniformity and had higher economic benefits. Therefore, the use of the external sprinkler cooling method in double-skeleton greenhouses is suitable for summer <i>lentinula edodes</i> production in the Gobi Desert region of southern Xinjiang.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study investigated the effects of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 supplementation on broiler performance, antioxidant capacity, and cecal microbes. A total of 288 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into three groups. The control group were fed a basal diet, and experimental groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with 250 and 500 mg/kg <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 (BS250 and BS500), respectively. The results showed that <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 supplementation increased the average daily feed intake but decreased the feed to gain ratio in broilers from 0 to 14, 0 to 28, and 0 to 42 days. Meanwhile, BS500 significantly decreased triglyceride and serum urea nitrogen levels compared with the control and BS250 groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 improved the antioxidant capacity by increasing the serum and jejunum levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, decreasing that of malondialdehyde and increasing the jejunum mRNA expression of <i>SOD2</i>, <i>CAT</i>, <i>GPX1</i>, and <i>Nrf2</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Dietary <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 supplementation increased the villus height, velvet concealed ratio, and the mRNA expressions of <i>IL-2</i>, <i>IL-4</i>, <i>IL-10</i>, and <i>IL-12</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, the Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, <i>Helicobacter</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae UCG-001</i> were significantly increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in the BS500 group. In conclusion, dietary <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BC02 supplementation can improve the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microflora abundances in broilers.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Udder conformation traits interact with cow milk yield, and it is essential to study the udder characteristics at different levels of production to predict milk yield for managing cows on farms. This study aims to develop an effective method based on instance segmentation and an improved neural network to divide cow production groups according to udders of high- and low-yielding cows. Firstly, the SOLOv2 (Segmenting Objects by LOcations) method was utilized to finely segment the cow udders. Secondly, feature extraction and data processing were conducted to define several cow udder features. Finally, the improved CNN-LSTM (Convolution Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) neural network was adopted to classify high- and low-yielding udders. The research compared the improved CNN-LSTM model and the other five classifiers, and the results show that CNN-LSTM achieved an overall accuracy of 96.44%. The proposed method indicates that the SOLOv2 and CNN-LSTM methods combined with analysis of udder traits have the potential for assigning cows to different production groups.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Pollinators provide crucial ecosystem services, i.e., pollination, which determines crops&rsquo; reproductive fitness and yield. As pollinators decline, flowering crops might face pollination-deficit stress depending on their dependence on pollinators and pollinator availability. Here, we assessed the dependency of some crops (belonging to diverse plant families) on biotic pollinators based on their maximum reproductive potential in a supplementary pollination treatment and minimum reproductive success in a pollinator exclusion treatment. Additionally, we determined the pollen transfer limitation of the crops in open field conditions. We also determined the influence of the different reproductive traits with the index of dependency of crops on pollinators (<i>IDP</i>) and the coefficient of pollination deficit (<i>D</i>). Based on the values of <i>IDP</i>, members of Cucurbitaceae are obligatorily dependent on pollinators for their fruit set. Members of Brassicaceae and Rutaceae are highly reliant on pollinators. A few crops, like <i>Lablab purpureus</i> and <i>Nigella sativa</i>, are less dependent on pollinators. In open field conditions, most crops have a low pollination deficit, some without pollen transfer limitations, and only a few crops (<i>Citrus &times; limon</i> and <i>Citrus maxima</i>) show a higher pollination deficit. The <i>IDP</i> is negatively influenced by the pollen&ndash;ovule ratio, which also negatively affects the pollination deficit of the crops. This study will be useful in understanding and mitigating the effects of pollinator losses, as well as in choosing crops (those under pollination deficit stress and largely dependent on pollinators for fruit set) for supplemental pollination services to increase agricultural production.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study investigated the composition of sugars, organic acids, individual and total phenolic compounds in the pulp, peel, leaves, and bark of a red-fleshed &lsquo;Baya Marisa&rsquo; apple cultivar. As the fruit is known for its red pulp color, the study focused on comparing the profiles of primary and selected secondary metabolites in three sections along the equatorial fruit plane. The analyses were carried out using HPLC&ndash;MS system, and compositional differences were compared among fruit segments. Inner fruit segments accumulated higher levels of sorbitol and the sum of sugars and lower levels of citric acid. However, no differences in the sum of organic acids could be determined among segments. The phenolic composition differed among pulp (hydroxycinnamic acids &gt; dihydrochalcones &asymp; anthocyanins &asymp; flavanols &gt; flavonols), peel (flavanols &gt; anthocyanins &gt; dihydrochalcones &gt; flavonols &gt; hydroxycinnamic acids), leaves (flavonols &gt; dihydrochalcones &gt; hydroxycinnamic acids &gt; anthocyanins), and bark (dihydrochalcones &gt; flavonols &gt; flavanols &gt; anthocyanins &gt; hydroxycinnamic acids). The greatest phenolic diversity was detected in bark (25), followed by leaves (18), peel (17) and finally, pulp (11). Three anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-galactoside &gt; cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-arabinoside &gt; peonidin-3-<i>O</i>-galactoside) were determined in all &lsquo;Baya Marisa&rsquo; tissues with their content highest in the peel. The innermost sections of the fruit were characterized by higher levels of dihydrochalcones and lower levels of most flavanols, flavonols and anthocyanins. These were predominant in the apple pulp nearest to the peel, with cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-galactoside being the prevalent representative. Accumulation of anthocyanins in pulp is a rare trait in apples, and therefore, the distinct distribution and diversity of metabolites in this cultivar highlights its potential for high-nutrient products such as juices, apple chips or purees.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The article continues the exposition of the results obtained in researching an agricultural machine for processing soil, designed for research with applications including exploitation. The MCLS (<i>complex machine for soil tillage</i>) was designed to research the working processes of the instruments intended for soil processing. The MCLS cultivator is a modulated machine (it can work for three working widths: 1, 2, and 4 m, with tractors of different powers) that is designed to use a wide range of working bodies. The experimental data obtained with the structure with a working width of 1 m and the results of their processing within the framework of the theory of random vibrations are presented in this article. The experimental results are analysed as random vibrations of the supports of the active working bodies. As a result, the main characteristics of random vibrations are exposed: the distribution function, the average value, the autocorrelation, and the frequency spectrum. These general results regarding random vibrations are used for several critical applications in the design, execution, and exploitation of some subassemblies and assemblies of agricultural machines of this type. The main applications include estimating the probability of the occurrence of dangerous load peaks, counting and selecting the load peaks that produce fatigue accumulation in the material of the supports of the working bodies, identifying some design deficiencies or defects in the work regime, and estimating the effects of vibrations on the quality of soil processing. All of the outcomes are composed of applications in MCLS research and exploitation. The applications pursue well-known objectives of modelling the working processes of agricultural machines: safety at work, increasing the quality of work, optimising energy consumption, and increasing productivity, all in a broad context to obtain a compromise situation. The material and the method are based on experimental data acquisition, processing, and interpretation.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between plant protection and fertilizer use efficiency, on one side, and overinvestment in Polish agriculture, on the other. This is an important topic because of a number of essential issues, such as the concern for the environment, the development of sustainable agriculture, or the need to ensure food security which can only be achieved by keeping production volumes at least at the same level. Reconciling these goals often requires investment which, however, involves the risk of overinvesting, i.e., a situation where the value of assets grows without a proportional increment in labor productivity. This paper uses the author&rsquo;s own method of farm classification by overinvestment level. The study revealed some differences in the cost intensity of fertilizing and using plant-protection products between investment levels. The most rational results were found in farms at optimum investment levels, whereas the greatest cost intensity was recorded in farms affected by overinvestment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Accurate segmentation of lotus pods and stalks with pose variability is a prerequisite for realizing the robotic harvesting of lotus pods. However, the complex growth environment of lotus pods causes great difficulties in conducting the above task. In this study, an instance segmentation model, LPSS-YOLOv5, for lotus pods and stalks based on the latest YOLOv5 v7.0 instance segmentation model was proposed. The CBAM attention mechanism was integrated into the network to improve the model&rsquo;s feature extraction ability. The scale distribution of the multi-scale feature layer was adjusted, a 160 &times; 160 small-scale detection layer was added, and the original 20 &times; 20 large-scale detection layer was removed, which improved the model&rsquo;s segmentation accuracy for small-scale lotus stalks and reduced the model size. On the medium-large scale test set, LPSS-YOLOv5 achieved a mask mAP<sub>0</sub>.<sub>5</sub> of 99.3% for all classes. On the small-scale test set, the mAP<sub>0</sub>.<sub>5</sub> for all classes and AP<sub>0</sub>.<sub>5</sub> for stalks were 88.8% and 83.3%, which were 2.6% and 5.0% higher than the baseline, respectively. Compared with the mainstream Mask R-CNN and YOLACT models, LPSS-YOLOv5 showed a much higher segmentation accuracy, speed, and smaller size. The 2D and 3D localization tests verified that LPSS-YOLOv5 could effectively support the picking point localization and the pod&ndash;stalk affiliation confirmation.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Germination of castor seeds of seven dwarf hybrid genotypes, compared to a &lsquo;Local&rsquo; genotype, selected from a Tunisian population by the University of Catania well adapted to the Mediterranean environment, were studied at six different temperatures (8, 12, 16, 25, 32, and 40 &deg;C). The results indicate that the optimal temperature (25 &deg;C) and near-optimal temperature (32 &deg;C) are the best temperatures for ensuring castor germination (final germination percentage (FGP) &ge; 82.81%). Furthermore, these temperatures positively influenced the vigour index (VI) and the radicle elongation. At a temperature of 8 &deg;C, no germination occurred, while temperatures of 12 and 40 &deg;C negatively affected the seed germination, which, in some genotypes, was null or negligible (&lt;21.25%). A temperature of 16 &deg;C allowed good results to be reached for the FGP and the other considered parameters. Overall, the dwarf hybrids performed better at high temperatures than at low temperatures, thus, making them suitable for late sowings, with the exception of the genotype &lsquo;C1020&rsquo;, which resulted the best performance at 16 and 40 &deg;C, being suitable for both early and late sowings. On the other hand, the &lsquo;Local&rsquo; castor genotype, being the best-performing genotype at 12 and 16 &deg;C, and the most tolerant to low temperature (base temperature (<i>T</i>b) 12.1 &deg;C), could be used in the early sowing in spring.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Straw return benefits soil nutrient circulation and avoids the environmental pollution caused by incineration. The straw return effect is determined by many factors, such as the returning mode and tillage method. To find the most suitable straw return mode in the hilly areas of south China, we conducted experiments with preceding maize straw in Nanchong (Sichuan Province, China) for three years. Five treatments were tested: (A) rotary tillage without straw return (RT), (B) crushed straw return with rotary tillage (CRT), (C) crushed straw return without rotary tillage (CSR), (D) whole straw return with rotary tillage (WRT), and (E) whole straw return without rotary tillage (WSR). The results indicated that CRT had the fastest decomposition rate, followed by CSR. Moreover, CRT had the fastest nutrient release rates for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as well as the highest maize yield (6.62% higher than RT). CRT increased the content of organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium in the soil, as well as improved the soil pH. Furthermore, the numbers of bacteria, Actinomycetes, and fungi in the soil under CRT, CSR, and WSR treatments were higher than those under the other two treatments. This study has important reference value for exploring the most favourable straw return method for improving farmland fertility.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In recent times, there has been a growing interest in the role of food trade in achieving food security. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between food trade and food security within the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This study employs complex networks alongside the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression method on trade data of 46 countries under BRI for the period 2008 to 2018. The resulting complex network showed an enhancement in the food trade relationships and food security levels after BRI, indicating a mutually positive effect. In addition, the closeness centrality measure showed a strong correlation with food security, indicating that food trade has positive spillovers on food security in the proximate countries. Using geographical distance as an instrumental variable, the QAP regression model proved the positive effects of food trade on food security. More investment in trade infrastructure is recommended to reduce the negative effect of geographical distance on food security.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In order to provide basic data and a theoretical basis for waste mulch film crushing and separation equipment, the mechanical and suspension properties of waste mulch film and cotton stalk were determined in this study. In the mechanical properties test, the tensile properties of waste mulch film and the shear properties of different parts of cotton stalk were investigated. In the suspension properties test, the suspension properties of different qualities of waste mulch film and different parts of cotton stalk were investigated. The results showed that the average maximum tensile forces and fracture displacements of the waste mulch film were 1.70 N (horizontal), 0.80 N (vertical) and 254.75 mm (horizontal), 145.22 mm (vertical). The shear properties of the cotton stem after wrapping the mulch film were greatly improved; the maximum shearing force was 186.89% higher than that of the unwrapped specimens. When the total suspension velocity was from 3.09 to 4.07 m/s, separation of mulch film and cotton stalk could be achieved by wind.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Fungus gnats (Sciaridae) are one of the most devastating pests on mushroom farms. Generally, they are controlled using relatively inefficient physical means, like sticky or pheromone traps, or with chemical pesticides. Here, we have proposed an integrated fungus gnat control system combining a UV-A LED source at 365 nm and a high-power laser diode at 445 nm. The 365 nm UV-A LED serves a light trap, since previous studies have concluded that fungus gnats show maximum attraction in the range of 365&ndash;390 nm. The UV-A LED is also modulated at different frequencies, and the response of the gnats corresponding to these different frequencies was observed. We utilized an Arduino Uno microcontroller to run the integrated device, and a BASLER USB camera was used to capture the images. Our experiments indicated that a frequency of 40 Hz is the optimal choice for attracting the gnats most rapidly. Within 20 s of exposure, the UV-A LED operated at 40 Hz was found to trap approximately 80% of the gnats. In a restricted trapping zone measuring 2.5 &times; 2.5 &times; 3 cm<sup>3</sup>, our integrated module, which includes a 40 Hz modulated UV-A LED and a laser, resulted in a survival rate of only 50% for the total number of gnats. This outcome was accomplished through periodic 200 ms long exposures, amounting to a total duration of 2 min for a group of 100 gnats.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Extensive collar rot, sunken and bleeding cankers, shoot blight, and fruit rot symptoms on olive trees have recently been observed in several orchards in Italy. Since there is little information about the etiology of these diseases and given the high economic relevance of this iconic crop, a study was conducted from autumn 2017 to summer 2022, in four Italian regions, to define the occurrence, distribution and impact of the main pathogens involved. A total of 1064 symptomatic olive samples were collected and processed. Based on colony appearance, micromorphological analysis and DNA sequence data, thirty-eight species, including eighteen <i>Botryosphaeriaceae</i> species belonging to five genera and fifteen <i>Phytophthora</i> species, were isolated and identified, thirteen of which, <i>Diplodia africana</i>, <i>D. fraxini</i>, <i>D. subglobosa</i>, <i>Dothiorella omnivora</i>, <i>Do. sarmentorum</i>, <i>Do. sempervirentis</i>, <i>Sardiniella urbana</i> (<i>Botryosphaeriaceae</i>), <i>Phytophthora cactorum</i>, <i>P. cinnamomi</i>, <i>P. citricola</i>, <i>P. crassamura</i>, <i>P. niederhauserii</i> and <i>P. pseudocryptogea</i>, are reported here for the first time in olive trees. Pathogenicity tests performed on unripe drupes and on potted olive seedlings completed Koch postulates and highlighted that several species of <i>Botryosphaeriaceae</i> and <i>Phytophthora</i> represent a growing threat to olive trees.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>China has implemented an environmental protection tax for large-scale agricultural farming to address environmental pollution caused by livestock and poultry breeding. Studying the environmental management of large-scale pig farming is crucial for controlling agricultural pollution. However, the economic impact and effectiveness of the current tax design, including responsibility sharing, tax rates, and taxpayers, are unclear. This study aims to address these gaps. Firstly, two types of taxation principles, production-based and consumption-based, are established, and their effects on pollution emissions distribution between pig production and marketing areas are comparatively analyzed. Secondly, the economic impact of consumption-based environmental taxes is estimated from inter-provincial and rural&ndash;urban perspectives under the current tax mechanism. Thirdly, a new alternative tax rate aligned with inter-provincial pig consumption levels is proposed based on the consumption principle. By comparing alternative tax systems, the potential impact of the current environmental tax on the regional economic burden is analyzed. The results highlighted that a production-based tax system resulted in 83% of regions experiencing varying degrees of implicit emission transfers, and a consumption-based tax system helped coordinate the environmental economic burden between pig production and marketing regions. Additionally, a linear relationship between tax rates and pork consumption expenditure not only alleviated the overall economic burden, leading to tax savings in 30% of regions, but also increased the national environmental revenue from the pig farming industry, resulting in a remarkable 147% rise in overall environmental tax revenue. These findings provide theoretical support for adjusting responsibility and economic burden through environmental tax modifications, facilitating the establishment of a compensation mechanism for the benefits between pig production and marketing areas.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Japonica</i>-specific markers are crucial for the analysis of genetic diversity, population structure, evolutionary traits, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) of <i>japonica</i> germplasm accessions. This study developed 402 insertion&ndash;deletion (InDel) polymorphic markers based on the re-sequencing of four <i>japonica</i> rice landraces and three <i>japonica</i> rice cultivars. These InDel markers were uniformly distributed across 12 rice chromosomes with high polymorphism and good amplification specificity. The average density of InDel markers on each chromosome was 0.95 Mb per locus. On the basis of these InDel markers, genetic diversity analyses and GWASs for 12 salt-tolerance-related traits were performed using 182 <i>japonica</i> rice accessions. In total, 1204 allelic variants were detected, with an average of 3.00 alleles and 2.10 effective alleles per locus. Based on population structure analysis, 182 <i>japonica</i> rice accessions were divided into four subgroups. The GWAS analyses revealed a total of 14 salt-tolerance-related InDels, which were located on chromosomes 1&ndash;5, 9, 10, and 12. Twenty-eight allelic loci were identified, explaining 6.83% to 11.22% of the phenotypic variance. Haplotype analysis detected six InDel markers associated with salt-tolerance-related traits that were significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) or highly significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) among different haplotypes. These markers can be utilized for the molecular identification of salt-tolerant rice germplasm accessions.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The objective was to determine the effect of calcium propionate (CaPr) inclusion in the diet, at different periods on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of finishing lambs. Thirty-six Dorper &times; Katahdin crossbred male lambs (39.1 &plusmn; 0.44 kg BW) were housed in individual pens during a 42 d feeding period and assigned to four treatments (<i>n</i> = 9) consisting of CaPr administered at a dose of 10 g/lamb/d for 0 (control), 14, 28, or 42 d before slaughter. Final BW (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), dry matter intake (DMI), and ADG:DMI ratio increased quadratically (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) by CaPr supplementation, being optimal at an estimated inclusion period of 25 d for FBW and ADG, 15 d for DMI, and 28 d for ADG:DMI ratio. Hot carcass weight (HCW), cold carcass weight (CCW), and dressing were quadratically improved (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) at an estimated inclusion period of 24 d for HCW and CCW, and 20 d for dressing. The increased inclusion period (42 d) augmented fat thickness (linear effect, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At 28 d of CaPr supplementation, maximal response (quadratic effect, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) was estimated in the empty body weight at 28 d, forequarter at 26 d, and neck at 24 d, but a longer inclusion period (42 d) increases the weight of leg and rack and reduced the proportion of loin as a percentage of CCW (linear effect, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, dietary CaPr can be included for a period of 24 to 28 d to improve growth performance and carcass weight, without affecting organ mass or meat quality.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In view of the low level of mechanized harvesting of white radish in China and other developing countries and the current situation of &ldquo;no machine can be used&rdquo; due to the expensive imported machines, a self-propelled white radish combine harvester was designed based on the material, growth characteristics, and agronomic pattern of white radish. This combines harvester can realize the functions of white radish tassel gathering, deep soil loosening, clamping and conveying, tassel cutting, and collecting. In this research, the overall design of the harvester is described, and the structural and working parameters and kinematic requirements of the tassel gathering device, clamping and conveying device, tassel cutting device, and vibrating deep loosening device are determined by mechanical and kinematic analysis. Innovatively, a range of values for the tassel gathering speed ratio of 1.7&ndash;4.2 is proposed for the operation of the tassel gathering device suitable for white radish harvesting. The prototype was bench tested with the loss rate, damaged rate, and impurity rate as performance evaluation indexes. The results show that under the pitch of 240 mm between the taper angle of the tassel-raising device, a speed of 80 rpm for the tassel gathering device gathering claw belt rotation, a speed of 120 rpm for the clamping and conveying pulley rotation, a vibration frequency of 2 Hz and an amplitude of 15 mm for the vibrating deep loosening device, and a forward speed of 0.5 m/s (tassel gathering speed ratio: 1.7). The loss rate was 2.75%, the damage rate was 4.99%, and the impurity rate was 1.64%. During the operation, the innovatively designed white radish leaf gathering device can better fulfill the function of tassel gathering, and the systems worked well together, meeting the requirements of mechanized combined harvesting of white radish, but the adaptability to complex working conditions in the field needs to be further strengthened. This research can provide a reference for the design and optimization of mechanized white radish harvesting equipment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To enhance the working efficiency and aerodynamic performance of the centrifugal fan in the air system of a cotton picker, a new type of centrifugal fan blade was designed by extracting the mid-arc section from the prototype blade and integrating an airfoil, which was transplanted and coupled to the mid-arc section. The design aimed to improve the airflow characteristics and performance of the centrifugal fan. By combining experimental data from centrifugal fans used in existing cotton-picker air systems and employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, the internal flow field structure of the centrifugal fan was simulated. This study focused on investigating the aerodynamic performance of the new centrifugal fan blade and its impact on improving the internal flow patterns within the centrifugal fan. The results of the flow field visualization analysis indicate that the new blade design exhibits excellent aerodynamic performance, improving the flow distribution within the centrifugal fan. It enhances the uniformity of the outlet airflow, reduces the occurrence of localized &ldquo;jet-wake&rdquo; phenomena at the impeller&rsquo;s outlet, suppresses the generation and development of vortices in the flow channel, and reduces local energy losses within the impeller. These improvements contribute to an increase in the fan&rsquo;s efficiency. Under rated operating conditions, the efficiency of the prototype fan was measured at 60.3%, while the optimized fan achieved an efficiency of 64.8%. This signifies a significant improvement in the efficiency of the centrifugal fan.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>A synchronous-profiling, low-position-cutting, flexible-reel-belt-conveyor, low-loss soybean header was designed to address the problems of a lack of soybean harvesting machines supporting soybean-corn strip intercropping, the few existing soybean headers, and the high loss rate of soybean headers. By establishing a dynamic model of the synchronous-profiling cutting device, the key structure and operation parameters that affect the performance of synchronous profiling were determined, while the key parameters of the flexible-reel-belt conveyor device were determined by theoretical analysis. Based on ADAMS rigid-flexible coupling, simulation analysis was conducted on the working process of the synchronous-profiling cutting device, verifying that the profiling cutting device can effectively control the height of the cutter off the ground with undulating ground and that the cutting device can accurately and quickly respond to ground excitation, meeting the requirements of synchronous-profiling, low-position cutting. Field tests showed that the loss rate and stubble height of the soybean headers are 1.34% and 70.36 mm, respectively, which are 55% and 22.7% lower than the existing reel-type rigid soybean headers, meeting the actual production requirements. This study can provide a reference for the structural design of soybean harvesting headers and the reduction of header losses.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Over the years, aquaponics has become a powerful technological tool that allows the sustainable production of food, integrating conventional fish farming with vegetable production. The present study evaluated the production of late seedlings of a&ccedil;ai <i>Euterpe oleraceae</i> in an aquaponic system with tambaqui <i>Colossoma macropomum</i>. A total of 36 tambaquis with an initial average weight and length of 1086.75 &plusmn; 16.38 g and 38.49 &plusmn; 0.90 cm were distributed in 12 independent aquaponic units, totaling 3.62 kg m<sup>&minus;3</sup>. The fish were fed three times daily with commercial feed at a rate of 3%. Three flooding levels of 5, 10 and 15 cm, with constant water flow through the hydroponic bed (0.5 m<sup>2</sup>), were evaluated, and a control-hydroponic bed with flooding levels of 10 cm was established, all in triplicate. In the 5 and 10 cm treatments, 3450 a&ccedil;ai seedlings with an initial height of 12.3 &plusmn; 1.9 cm were used (575 per aquaponic units), while the 15 cm treatment contained non-germinated a&ccedil;ai seeds. The control group did not receive a&ccedil;ai seeds and remained empty. Analyses to monitor total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, alkalinity, hardness, nitrogenous compounds, and phosphate levels were performed. At the end of the 30-day trial, the growth performance of tambaqui and plants was evaluated. Water quality was significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) affected by different flooding levels. Electrical conductivity and TDS decreased with an increasing in flooding levels. The flooding levels significantly influenced (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) the concentration of total ammonia and nitrate between the treatments. The 5 cm flooding level showed the best plant development indexes for total height, aerial portion height, root height and aerial portion fresh mass. No significant differences (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were observed in tambaqui growth performance. The aquaponic system proved to be effective in reusing fish waste (excreta and feed leftovers) generated in the system. The biotransformation of waste into nutrients allowed the growth of plants and nitrifying bacteria, which, through their metabolic pathways, ensured the purification and reuse of water, avoiding the discharge of this waste into the environment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The larvae of ermine moths from the Yponomeutidae family (Lepidoptera) feed on a range of species and varieties of fruit and ornamental trees. Some species of this family pose a serious threat to the environment, mainly because of the significant defoliation they cause but also due to the widespread use of insecticides used to control them. This study was designed to assess the sensitivity of <i>Yponomeuta padella</i> and <i>Yponomeuta cagnagella</i> larvae and pupae to a native strain of <i>Steinernema feltiae</i> ZAG15 nematodes under laboratory conditions and to test the biological activity of these nematodes against the larvae and pupae of these species in field studies. The following doses were used in the laboratory tests: 50 IJs/insect (Petri dish tests) and 100 IJs/insect (container tests). Petri dish and container tests were performed at 20 &deg;C and 60% humidity. Mortality of two stages (larvae and pupae) was determined 3 days after treatment. In the field trials, the nematodes were applied at the following doses: 4000 IJs/web for the caterpillars of <i>Y. padella</i> and <i>Y. cagnagella</i> and 1000 IJs/web for the pupae of <i>Y. padella</i> and <i>Y. cagnagella</i> (this corresponded to approximately 200 IJs/insect). Nematodes were applied using a 1 L hand sprayer and a lance. The efficacy of the application was assessed after seven days. The results of our study showed that the larvae (81.7%) and pupae (88.3%) of <i>Y. padella</i> had a greater susceptibility to entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) than those of <i>Y. cagnagella</i> (50% and 33.3%, respectively). However, our promising laboratory results did not translate into results in field trials, where the application of EPNs proved to be ineffective.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The study aimed to assess the quality of spraying of ornamental conifer using a multi-rotor drone. We examined how the speed of drone movement and the propellers&rsquo; spin speed can affect the deposition quality of the sprayed liquid in the crown of blue spruce (<i>Picea pungens</i> Engelm.). Due to the avoidance in the future of droplet drift by air movements, an air injector atomiser for liquid spraying was used, and a low altitude of 0.6 m of the drone flying above the tree was used in the study. The drone moved at two speeds: 0.57 m&middot;s<sup>&ndash;1</sup> and 0.94 m&middot;s<sup>&ndash;1</sup>. The propellers&rsquo; spin speeds were adjusted based on the drone&rsquo;s weight with the spray liquid tank filled and empty. The propellers&rsquo; zero-spin rate was also included to compare the drone to a field sprayer. The tests were conducted in a laboratory setting. Volume and uniformity of liquid volume settled on the levels of samplers positioned on a tripod within the tree canopy were assessed. The samplers were placed in two zones of the tree: near the tree trunk and at a distance of 0.21 m from the trunk. Airstream speed generated by drone propellers was also evaluated inside the tree. The findings indicated that the rotations of propellers and air speed significantly influenced the quality of liquid deposition on samplers located away from the trunk. The results also showed that using a drone instead of a field sprayer could benefit the quality of the spray application. The weight of the multi-rotor drone, determined by the spray liquid tank&rsquo;s filling level, can significantly impact the quality of spray deposition in the tree. Based on the investigations, it can be recommended that low-altitude spraying drones be adopted for studies and future strategies in precision agriculture using autonomous inspection-spraying drones.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Accurate temperature prediction and modeling are critical for effective management of agricultural greenhouses. By optimizing control and minimizing energy waste, farmers can maintain optimal environmental conditions, leading to improved crop yields and reduced financial losses. In this study, multiple models, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were compared to predict greenhouse air temperature. External parameters, such as air temperature (T<sub>out</sub>), relative humidity (H<sub>out</sub>), wind speed (W), and solar radiation (S), were used as inputs for these models, and the output was the inside temperature. The results showed that the RBF model with the LM (Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt) learning algorithm outperformed the other models, achieving the lowest error and the highest coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) value. The RBF model produced RMSE, MAPE, and R<sup>2</sup> values of 1.32 &deg;C, 3.23%, and 0.931, respectively. These results demonstrate that the RBF model with the LM learning algorithm can reliably predict greenhouse air temperatures for the next two hours. The ANN model can be applied to optimize time management and reduce energy losses, improving the overall efficiency of greenhouse operations.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Aiming to address the problems of low working efficiency and high damage rate of high and low roller peeling equipment in the process of fresh corn harvesting in China, this paper theoretically analyzes the mechanical motion process between the peeling device and the corn ear, and a high&ndash;low roll peeling structure is proposed. This structure incorporates elastomeric rubber material, a roller segmentation design, and an adjustable spiral frame, and the selection of relevant parameters is given. To determine the optimal operating parameters for the fresh-corn-peeling device, a three-factor, three-level orthogonal test was conducted using the Box&ndash;Behnken central grouping method in Design-Expert 12 software. The test factors were peeling roller speed, peeling roller tilt angle, and vibrating plate frequency. The evaluation indices considered were the bract peeling rate (BPR) and the grain breaking rate (GBR). Based on the theoretical analysis results, a test bench for the fresh-corn-ear-peeling device was established and the parameter combination for optimal peeling quality was determined according to the actual work situation. The results show that the impact on the BPR and GBR, from large to small, is in the following order: peeling roller speed, peeling roller tilt angle, and frequency vibration plate. The optimization module was used to optimize the operating parameters and used the following integers to obtain the optimal operating parameter combination: the peeling roller speed was 480 r&middot;min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; the peeling roller tilt angle was 8&deg;; the vibrating plate frequency was 260 times&middot;min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; the corresponding BPR was 91.75%, which was 0.66% points lower than the optimal value; and the GBR was 1.55%, which was 0.08% points higher than the optimal value. Notably, this fresh-corn-peeling equipment exhibited superior performance in terms of peeling fracture results compared with standard peeling equipment. Therefore, this study provides valuable technical support for the optimal design and selection of fresh-corn-peeling equipment.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Antimicrobial residues and resistance caused by farmers&rsquo; overuse of veterinary antimicrobials have seriously threatened food safety, the ecological environment, and public health. With the popularization of the Internet in rural areas, especially in developing countries, the constraints of obtaining agricultural technical information provided by governments or organizations are greatly eased, farmers&rsquo; knowledge and skills are significantly improved, and the agricultural standardized production system is effectively constructed. However, there is still a research gap on whether information acquisition via the Internet (IAI) can induce farmers to standardize the use of antimicrobials. Using the data of 675 hog farmers in the Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Hubei provinces, China, the IV-Heckman and mediating effect models were used to analyze the phenomenon empirically. The main findings revealed that the IAI had exerted a significant influence on the standardized use of veterinary antimicrobials by hog farmers, i.e., the IAI not only helped farmers to decide to standardize the use of antimicrobials but also reduced the amount of investment in the standardized use of antibiotics. Moreover, information-sharing and feedback mechanisms partially mediated the relationship between the IAI and farmers&rsquo; standardized use of antimicrobials. Finally, considering the heterogeneity of individual endowments, the study further revealed that the IAI significantly impacted the standardized use of antimicrobials for farmers below the age of 36 years. However, the IAI was found to positively and significantly promote farmers&rsquo; standardized-use decisions only if they had less than five years of breeding time.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Increasingly, in orchards around the world that are planted one after another, disturbances are observed, and these issues with growth and development are called replantation disease. It is manifested mainly by poor tree growth after planting and poor ripening. One way to reduce replantation disease is to improve soil fertility after many years of fruit tree cultivation. The aim of the work was to evaluate the growth and yield of cherries after replantation and to compare this with a site where fruit trees had not grown before. The trees were planted at two sites: after the replantation of the cherry orchard (OR1) and in a site where fruit trees had not been cultivated before (OR2). Two combinations were used in each orchard: boiler without mulching (C), mulch&mdash;after planting mulching with a substrate after growing mushrooms (M). The trees at the site after replantation grew and bore less fruit than in the position where fruit trees had not grown before. The disease also affected some of the quality characteristics of the fruit. This resulted in an increase in fruit weight and a darker color (L*) and a higher value of hue fruit color. Mulching, which is often recommended in orchards planted after previous cultivation, did not provide the expected improvement. It did not significantly affect tree growth and yield. Only an effect on the content of components in the soil was observed, but it affected the condition of the trees. In addition, we analyzed how experimental combinations responded to climatic conditions by calculating the correlations between the SAT (sum of active temperatures) and the stages of tree development.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of three forms of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) and their effect on the yield, chemical and microbiological quality of perennial ryegrass herbage and silage. Two types of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) and a commercial product, labeled here as TiO<sub>2</sub>Com, were selected for the studies. The yield and chemical parameters of herbage did not improve significantly in response to the TiO<sub>2</sub> treatment, in comparison to the control group (CONT). The crude protein content of silage was significantly lower in the TiO<sub>2</sub>Com-treated group than in the TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs2 group (117 vs. 129 g kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> dry matter (DM)). The use of water-soluble carbohydrates during fermentation was limited in the TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs2 and TiO<sub>2</sub>Com groups. The fermentation pattern was similar for each investigated group, and a significant difference in pH values was noted between the TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs2 (pH = 4.49) and CONT (pH = 4.68) group. Lactic acid concentration was the highest in the TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs1 group (94.8 g kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> DM), and the difference relative to the CONT group (83.2 g kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> DM) was statistically significant. It was concluded that TiO<sub>2</sub> and its nanoparticles have the potential to improve the physicochemical and microbiological quality of herbage and silage.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The V4 countries (Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary) hold significant importance within the European Union, contributing nearly 20% of the EU&rsquo;s arable land and 10% of its crop output from 2018 to 2020. The study focuses on companies as organizational entities engaged in arable crop production, representing a specific segment of agricultural producers. The objective is to analyze the concentration and financial performance of these companies in the V4 countries during the period 2018&ndash;2020. Financial data from 822 companies in Hungary, 226 in Slovakia, 17 in Czechia, and 967 in Poland were processed from the EMIS database (Emerging Market Information System). In Poland and Czechia, a significant proportion of the companies were classified as micro-enterprises, while in Hungary and Slovakia, they were predominantly small farms. The Gini index indicates a high concentration of Polish farms, a medium concentration of Hungarian and Slovakian farms, and a low concentration of Czech companies. In terms of financial profitability, Hungarian and Polish companies are the most favorable, while Slovak farms are the least favorable. Polish companies exhibit significant heterogeneity, which may also be attributed to high concentration. The results suggest that higher financial profitability is associated with a lower debt rate in the capital structure. Based on the examined sample, there is no close relationship between farm size and financial efficiency in the case of companies engaged in arable crop production in the V4 countries. This study also found that as farm size increases, the profit (EBIT) tends to increase, but the magnitude of this effect varies among the companies in different countries. The study&rsquo;s findings also support that other factors play a role in the development of profitability.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Biopesticides are perceived as a feasible alternative to chemical pesticides, providing an effective approach to pest management while mitigating the undesirable effects of chemical pesticide overuse. Yet, due to the distinctive attributes of the two types of pesticides, farmers often adopt a combination of both. This study aimed to probe the interdependent relationship underlying the mixed use of chemical pesticides and biopesticides by farmers in the rice&ndash;crayfish integrated system (RCIS) in Hubei province, China. We also sought to identify influencing factors and associated consequences of this practice. Given that the adoption of chemical pesticides and biopesticides by farmers is not mutually exclusive, a multivariable probit model was utilized to estimate simultaneous pesticide applications. Survey data from 736 RCIS farmers revealed that 10.50% of the sample farmers employ a combination of chemical pesticides and biopesticides. A substitution relationship was observed between the adoption of chemical pesticides and biopesticides by farmers, whereas no significant complementary relationship was found in the application of the two types of pesticides. The primary motivation for the mixed use of pesticides by farmers is to achieve superior pest control efficacy. Notably, when integrating the use of pesticides, farmers pay less attention to factors such as resource endowments and multiple production objectives. Further analysis indicated that farmers display significant concern for pesticide attributes including insecticidal efficacy, toxicity, insecticidal spectrum, and validity period. The mixed use of pesticides has resulted in a decreased frequency of pesticide application but has escalated the cost. While the mixed use of pesticides elevated the selling price of rice, no significant improvement was observed in yield and output value. The insights garnered from this study offer strategic implications for policymakers on how to enhance the judicious adoption of pesticides by farmers.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To meet the working performance demand of cotton pickers, a hydrostatic power shift composite drive system design is proposed. This study aims to enhance the driving function of the cotton picker in various working conditions and improve its adaptability by combining a hydrostatic speed control system with a mechanical power shift structure. To achieve this, a single variable pump + double variable motor closed circuit is adopted. By adjusting the pump and motor displacement in stages, the driving speed of the cotton picker can be optimized for different working conditions. Additionally, the power shift mechanism is employed to increase the speed range and improve the transmission efficiency, enabling higher speeds to be achieved. Firstly, the main components of the composite drive system were calculated and selected, and then AMESim software was used for modeling and simulation analysis, and the results are as follows: When the cotton picker starts and picking operation stage variable displacement pump + fixed displacement dual motor speed control, the highest driving speed is 8.5 km/h. During the field and road transport operation stage fixed displacement pump + variable displacement dual motor speed regulation, the highest speed of 14.5 km/h was achieved in the field. When transferring to the road, the instant mechanical power shift speed and, the highest speed on the road was up to 27.5 km/h. Finally, the field experiment and speed ratio analysis of the drive system was conducted, and the average error of the experimental speed measurement was 0.588%. The speed ratio matching was in line with the design expectation. The results show that the hydrostatic power shift composite drive system designed in this study has good driving adaptability and can effectively meet the functions of cotton picker field picking, transport operation and road transportation in transit, which provides theoretical support for the design of cotton picker chassis drive system.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are primary indicators of soil nutrients in agriculture. Accurate management of these nutrients is essential for ensuring food security. High-resolution, multi-spectral remote sensing images can provide crucial information for mapping soil nutrients at the field scale. This study compares the capabilities of ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with different spectral indices, in mapping soil nutrients (total N and Olsen-P) using two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). Two agricultural fields in Suihua City were selected as the study areas for this investigation. The results showed that Sentinel-2 data performed best in computing the total N content in soil using the RF model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.74, <i>RMSE</i> = 0.10 g/kg). However, for the soil Olsen-P content, the XGBoost model performed better with ZH-1 data (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75, <i>RMSE</i> = 9.79 mg/kg) than the RF model. This study demonstrates that both ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data perform well in terms of accurately mapping soil total N and Olsen-P contents using machine learning. Due to its higher spectral and spatial resolution, ZH-1 remote sensing data provides more detailed information on soil nutrient content during Olsen-P inversion and exhibits comparable accuracy.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The aims of this study were to analyze in depth the impact of agricultural machinery socialization services on the scale of land operation and to examine whether agricultural machinery socialization services can effectively alleviate the constraints faced by the scale of land operation. Accordingly, a systematic theoretical analysis and derivation of a farmer production model were first conducted to show that the adoption of agricultural machinery socialization services by farmers alleviated the financial, technical, and labor constraints they faced and facilitated the expansion of the farming scale. Subsequently, the OLS model, three-stage least squares, seemingly uncorrelated Biprobit association model, and Probit model were used based on survey data of maize farmers in 13 Chinese provinces in 2019. The endogeneity of simultaneous decision-making between farmers&rsquo; adoption of farm machinery socialization services and operation scale was assessed. Then, we empirically tested the effects of agricultural machinery socialization services on the operation scale under different part-time situations and terrain conditions. The empirical study shows that there is a significant contribution of farmers&rsquo; adoption of agricultural machinery socialization services to the scale of land operation. The adoption of agricultural machinery socialization services by purely agricultural household groups has a more significant effect on increasing the scale of land management. Moreover, the adoption of agricultural machinery socialization services significantly increases the scale of land management only among farmers on flat land as compared to farmers on sloping land. The research results help to dissect the relationship between agricultural machinery socialization services and operation scale and provide insights for developing agricultural machinery socialization service systems and expanding operation scale.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Background: Recently, there has been a growing demand for the mechanization of flower harvesting to enhance harvesting efficiency. Therefore, the purpose of the current research was to design a jasmine flower automated picker system (JFAPS). The picking system incorporates a gripper that moves along the third vertical axis using an Intel depth camera and the You Only Look Once (YOLO-V5) deep learning system to locate and detect the flowers. Results: For different design cross-sections, it was observed that the least safe factor of design safety was considered high enough to marginalize any mechanical failure potential. Furthermore, according to the prediction box, the flowers&rsquo; center point on the pixel plane was detected, while the real vertical position of the flowers was computed using a deep learning system. Consequently, the gripper moves down to pick the flowers and convey them to the storage system. In these conditions, the detection method&rsquo;s average precision and recall of flowers were 100% and 90%, respectively. Conclusions: The JFAPS was balanced and efficient in detecting flowers. Therefore, future efforts will be directed at evaluating this system and confirming its efficacy in collecting flowers on an experimental farm.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Rice is a staple food crop that plays a pivotal role in global food security, feeding more than half of the world&rsquo;s population. Soil salinity is one of the most important global problems affecting rice productivity. Salt stress at the seedling stage inhibits root growth, impairs nutrient and water uptake, and affects overall plant vigor, resulting in poor establishment and reduced growth. Therefore, acquiring salt tolerance, especially at the seedling stage, is critical for successful rice production in salinity-affected areas. In this study, 160 RILs derived from a cross between Pokkali and KDML105 were evaluated for their salt tolerance at the seedling stage. QTL-seq analysis with this population identified nine QTLs associated with salt tolerance. Through a comprehensive examination of the effects of coding sequence variants of the 360 annotated genes within the QTLs and gene expression under salt stress, 47 candidate genes were prioritized. In particular, Os01g0200700 (metallothionein-like protein) and Os12g0625000 (O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase) were suggested as potential candidates based on annotated functions and expression data. The results provide valuable insights for improving rice productivity and resistance under salt stress conditions during the critical seedling stage.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Crop characterization is considered a prerequisite to devising effective strategies for ensuring successful implementation of sustainable agricultural management strategies. As such, remote-sensing technology has opened an exciting horizon for crop characterization at reasonable spatial, spectral, and temporal scales. However, the presence of shadows on croplands tends to distort radiometric properties of the crops, subsequently limiting the retrieval of crop-related information. This study proposes a simple and reliable approach for radiometrically compensating crops under total occlusion using brightness-based compensation and thresholding approaches. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was used to characterize crops at the experimental site. In this study, shadow was demarcated through the computation and use of mean spectral radiance values as the threshold across spectral channels of UAV imagery. Several image classifiers, viz., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), maximum likelihood, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and image segmentation, were used to categorize land features, with a view to determine the areal coverage of crops prior to the radiometric compensation process. Radiometric compensation was then performed to restore radiometric properties of land features under occlusion by performing brightness tuning on the RGB imagery. Radiometric compensation results revealed maize and soil as land features subjected to occlusion. The relative error of the mean results for radiance comparison between lit and occluded regions revealed 26.47% deviation of the restored radiance of occluded maize from that of lit maize. On the other hand, the reasonable REM value of soil was noted to be 50.92%, implying poor radiometric compensation results. Postradiometric compensation classification results revealed increases in the areal coverage of maize cultivars and soil by 40.56% and 12.37%, respectively, after being radiometrically compensated, as predicted by the KNN classifier. The maximum likelihood, MLP, and segmentation classifiers predicted increases in area covered with maize of 18.03%, 22.42%, and 30.64%, respectively. Moreover, these classifiers also predicted increases in the area covered with soil of 1.46%, 10.05%, and 14.29%, respectively. The results of this study highlight the significance of brightness tuning and thresholding approaches in radiometrically compensating occluded crops.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>As the main demand side of rural financial services, farmers&rsquo; cooperatives are an important part of China&rsquo;s rural finance. However, due to the lack of effective collateral, farmers&rsquo; cooperatives have problems such as difficulty in obtaining loans or expensive loans, which not only hinder the high-quality development of farmers&rsquo; cooperatives, but also limit the development of regional rural finance. Digital credit as a new financing model can effectively alleviate the problems of difficult and expensive loans and has received wide attention from the government and academia. Based on this, this paper analyzes the digital credit behavior of farmers&rsquo; cooperatives in detail by applying the &ldquo;6C&rdquo; family model to the grounded theory, and constructs a theoretical analysis model of farmers&rsquo; cooperatives&rsquo; digital credit behavior. The findings are as follows: The motivation for the digital credit of farmers&rsquo; cooperatives is that the credit procedures are simple, the loan period is short, and the loan interest rate is low; the condition is the farmers&rsquo; cooperative reputation advantage and government policy support,; the main form is the participation of cooperatives in short- and long-cycle digital credit; and the consequence is reflected in increasing the income of cooperative members, improving the availability of cooperative loans, promoting cooperative credit building, and achieving sustainable agricultural development. Different participation motivations have different effects on the form of credit. When motivated by simple credit procedures and short loan periods, farmers&rsquo; cooperatives choose &ldquo;Huinong e-loan&rdquo;; when motivated by simple procedures and low loan interest rates, farmers&rsquo; cooperatives choose &ldquo;Funong Loan&rdquo;. Different forms of credit will produce different performances. Farmers&rsquo; cooperatives choosing &ldquo;Huinong e-loan&rdquo; will produce economic performance; farmers&rsquo; cooperatives choosing &ldquo;Funong Loan&rdquo; will produce economic performance and social performance. In order to deal with the problem of digital credit of farmers&rsquo; cooperatives, the government needs to improve the relevant policies and regulations, reduce credit risks, and establish a sound credit system to provide credit guarantees for cooperatives and farmers. Financial institutions need to improve their financial services and innovate financial products and services to meet the multi-level credit needs of cooperatives.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Understanding tourists&rsquo; perceptions and appreciation of traditional food products (TFPs) is crucial for developing effective marketing and development strategies for poor economies with tourism potential, such as Cambodia. Lots of TFPs are derived from underutilised plant species, which are generally undervalued in economic terms. The aim of the study was to analyse tourists&rsquo; familiarity with both conventional (i.e., wider known and used) and underutilised Cambodian TFPs. A total of 1271 international tourists were interviewed in the country&rsquo;s three most visited regions. A pairwise matrix was used to document tourists&rsquo; preferences, &chi;<sup>2</sup> test to determine associations between respondents&rsquo; preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, a bivariate probit model to examine factors influencing these attitudes, and an ordered probit model to analyse factors influencing willingness-to-pay for TFPs. A total of 923 respondents (72.6%) were familiar with at least one TFP. Kampot pepper, palm sugar and <i>Rumduol</i> rice were the best-known conventional TFPs, while <i>Maprang</i>, <i>Kramsang</i> and <i>Ma-om</i> were the better-known underutilised TFPs. Willingness-to-buy a TFP increased with prior knowledge of and familiarity with TFPs, education, religion and available budget. Low awareness, a short stay in Cambodia and possible health problems associated with their use were the main barriers to trying a TFP. Greater awareness, better organised distribution, improved packaging and labelling will be needed to increase TFP success among tourists, especially of those defined as underutilised.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Agriculture is a critical domain, where technology can have a significant impact on increasing yields, improving crop quality, and reducing environmental impact. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar power in agriculture has gained momentum in recent years due to the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of farming operations. In addition to providing a source of clean energy, solar tracking systems can also be used for remote weather monitoring in the agricultural field. The ability to collect real-time data on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall can help farmers make informed decisions on irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices. The main idea of this study is to present a system that can improve the efficiency of solar panels to provide constant power to the sensor in the agricultural field and transfer real-time data to the app. This research presents a mechanism to improve the arrangement of a photovoltaic (PV) array with solar power and to produce maximum energy. The proposed system changes its direction in two axes (azimuth and elevation) by detecting the difference between the position of the sun and the panel to track the sun using a light-dependent resistor. A testbed with a hardware experimental setup is designed to test the system&rsquo;s capability to track according to the position of the sun effectively. In the end, real-time data are displayed using the Android app, and the weather data are transferred to the app using a GSM/WiFi module. This research improves the existing system, and results showed that the relative increase in power generation was up to 52%. Using intelligent artificial intelligence techniques with the QoS algorithm, the quality of service produced by the existing system is improved.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Degradation in farmland quality owing to overuse emphasizes the current need for the adoption of protective technologies to ensure food security and sustainable resource utilization. This study employs plot survey data from Heilongjiang, Henan, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces in China to investigate how the spatial attributes of transferred plots influence the current adoption of farmland protection methods, such as deep tillage and straw-returning. Findings reveal that larger or interconnected transferred plots significantly increase the likelihood of farmers adopting conservation tillage technologies. However, the influence of the plot&rsquo;s location on technology adoption varies among different plots. As the farmland transfer market expands, the spatial features of these plots emerge as critical determinants in the use of protective technologies. This underscores the pressing need for an integrated farmland transfer trading system and strengthened policy measures promoting land consolidation to foster widespread adoption of these conservation strategies.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In Cambodia, rice is predominantly produced in areas with rainfed lowland conditions where photoperiod-sensitive varieties are cultivated. A number of varieties have been released for rainfed lowland areas, and the rice grain yield has reportedly increased by approximately 12% over the past ten years. Moreover, great fluctuations in yield performance have been observed across different soil types of the rainfed ecosystems of Cambodia. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the grain yield and stability among ten popular varieties that were released for rainfed lowland ecosystems across the four different soil types in Cambodia in two years. The grain yield varied 566 g m<sup>&minus;2</sup> as the highest in clay soil and about 220 g m<sup>&minus;2</sup> as the lowest in sandy soil. A combined ANOVA revealed significant differences for the main effect of genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) for all yield-related traits and grain yield per square meter. The principal component test results showed that the heterogeneity of grain yield was mainly attributable to the effect of environment, followed by the effect of genotype. In fertile conditions, a higher percentage of filled grains was supported by higher leaf N until the late stage with a wider flag leaf. In conditions of moderate fertility, larger numbers of panicles were supported by a higher percentage of productive culms with higher leaf N until the late stage. In conditions of poor fertility, a higher percentage of filled grains was supported by higher leaf N until the late stage, which is considered to be important for higher grain yield. The variety Phka Rumduol showed these preferable traits and produced higher yields in fertile to poor natural soil fertility conditions with moderate variation. This variety is considered to be more desirable and ideal due to its stability and higher grain yield. The other varieties, namely, Phka Mealdei, Phka Rumdeng, and CAR4, were identified as above-average yielders. Therefore, those varieties potentially may be recommended for cultivation in rainfed lowland rice ecosystems in Cambodia due to their high yields. CAR4 showed moderate variation at the same level as Phka Rumduol. From the point of stability, Phka Rumduol and CAR4 can be expected to excel.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Simulation systems have become essential tools for both researchers and virtual laboratory experiments. In the Agri-food-chain, SimAgri, a driving simulator for tractors and operating machines, has been developed for precision agriculture (PA) research and to train professional farm drivers. Using the virtual environment of the simulator, the influence and fine-tuning of PA operations logic may be evaluated by simulating existing systems, or designing new ones, in specially compared scenarios and setups. Current configurations include an agricultural tractor carrying or towing farm equipment such as sprayers, seeders and fertilizer, embedded sensors, human&ndash;machine interfaces that may be configured like a joystick, console and touchscreen, and four virtual environment monitors. The study describes the design choices that have made it possible to create a simulator aimed at precision agriculture, keeping auto guidance, geolocation, and operations with ISOBUS implements as pillars. This research aims to use a unique purpose-designed simulation platform, installed on a driver-in-the-loop simulator to provide data to objectify the benefits of PA criteria. Numerical and experimental data have been compared to ensure results reliability.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Sheep represent one of the main reservoirs of diarrheagenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>; this microorganism is an etiological agent of food-borne diseases; therefore, this work aimed to identify and characterize the principal pathotypes of diarrheagenic <i>E. coli</i> (DEC) obtained through rectal swabs and carcasses samples from sheep slaughtered in an abattoir at the central region of Mexico. The isolates were subjected to bacteriological identification, serotyping; phylogenetic classification; detection for virulence factors, and antimicrobial sensibility. A total of 90 <i>E. coli</i> isolates were obtained. It was observed through 49 <i>E. coli</i> isolates (54%), 8 of them from carcasses, and 43 from feces was DEC. DEC serotypes with health public relevance were found: O76:H19 (n = 5), O146:H21 (n = 3), O91:H10 (n = 1), O6:NM (n = 1), and O8:NM (n = 1). Regarding the presence of Shiga toxin-producing <i>E.coli</i> (STEC), 43/90 (47.7%) isolates have the <i>stx1</i> w/o <i>stx2</i> genes, and therefore were assigned as STEC non-O157; only one isolate expressed <i>stx1</i> and <i>eae</i> genes and was classified as t-STEC (typical STEC). Additionally, 3/90 (3.3%) harbored only the <i>eae</i> gene and were classified as enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (EPEC), the <i>stp</i> gene was found in 2/90 isolates (2.2%) and were classified as enterotoxigenic <i>E. coli</i> (ETEC); 1/90 (1.1%) isolates harboring the <i>ipaH</i> were classified as enteroinvasive <i>E. coli</i> EIEC. Regarding <i>stx1</i> genes subtypes, <i>stx1c</i> only was found in 60.5% (26/43), followed by <i>stx1a-stx1c</i> 20.9% (9/43) and <i>stx1a-stx1d</i> 2.3% (1/43). The presence of both, <i>stx1</i> and <i>stx2</i> genes was found in 7/43 isolates (16.3%) from rectal swabs; the combination <i>stx1c-stx2g</i> was detected in 3/43 isolates (6.9%), while 4 (9.4%) isolates showed different patterns (<i>stx1a-stx1c-stx2g</i>; <i>stx1c-stx2b-stx2g</i>; <i>stx1c-stx2b</i> and <i>stx1a-stx1c-stx2b-stx2g</i>). STEC isolates showed the major diversity of phylogenetic groups, although phylogroup B1 was predominant in 90.6% (39/43) while there was only one isolate (2.3%) in each remaining phylogroup (A, B2, C, and F). All EPEC, ETEC, and EIEC isolates were clustered in phylogroup B1. We observed that 27.9% (12/43) of STEC isolates carried at least one antibiotic resistance: nine isolates expressed the <i>tetB</i> gene, one isolate the <i>tetA</i> gene, two isolates the <i>sul2</i> gene, one isolate the <i>sul1</i> and one isolate the <i>sul1-tetB</i> genes. These results highlight the importance of diarrheagenic <i>E. coli</i> as a potential risk for public health during the slaughtering process.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Brewer&rsquo;s spent yeast (BSY) is a byproduct of the beer industry, rich in proteins and bioactive compounds. The effects of BSY were investigated through a 6-week feeding trial on 30 lactating dairy Blackhead sheep (54.7 &plusmn; 5.66 kg, 177.34 days in milk) distributed under a completely randomised design in two groups: a control group (with soybean meal and sunflower meal as protein sources), and a BSY group, where soybean meal was totally replaced by BSY (5.4% inclusion, DM basis). The inclusion of BSY led to a 25% decrease in ruminal propionate and in the acetate/propionate ratio. BSY influenced the milk fatty acid profile by significantly decreasing the omega 6: omega 3 ratio and increasing the contents of caproic, capric, and lauric acids. Also, the inclusion of BSY was associated with an increase in the milk&rsquo;s total polyphenols. Consistently, determinations of the parameters of the milk fat&rsquo;s oxidative stability revealed a decrease in conjugated diene contents. Moreover, the mineral contents of milk were influenced, with an increase in Ca content noted. Overall, these results indicate that BSY represents an alternative feedstuff for ruminants&rsquo; nutrition, which could have the potential to induce changes in ruminal fermentation and milk composition that are beneficial for consumers.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The automatic recognition of crop diseases based on visual perception algorithms is one of the important research directions in the current prevention and control of crop diseases. However, there are two issues to be addressed in corn disease identification: (1) A lack of multicategory corn disease image datasets that can be used for disease recognition model training. (2) The existing methods for identifying corn diseases have difficulty satisfying the dual requirements of disease recognition speed and accuracy in actual corn planting scenarios. Therefore, a corn diseases recognition system based on pretrained VGG16 is investigated and devised, termed as VGNet, which consists of batch normalization (BN), global average pooling (GAP) and L2 normalization. The performance of the proposed method is improved by using transfer learning for the task of corn disease classification. Experiment results show that the Adam optimizer is more suitable for crop disease recognition than the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. When the learning rate is 0.001, the model performance reaches a highest accuracy of 98.3% and a lowest loss of 0.035. After data augmentation, the precision of nine corn diseases is between 98.1% and 100%, and the recall value ranges from 98.6% to 100%. What is more, the designed lightweight VGNet only occupies 79.5 MB of space, and the testing time for 230 images is 75.21 s, which demonstrates better transferability and accuracy in crop disease image recognition.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Heavy metal pollution in agricultural fields is a serious health concern because of the high bioavailability and persistent toxicity of heavy metals. Much progress has recently been made with respect to elucidating the impacts of climate change (e.g., elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations) on the environmental behavior of heavy metal pollutants and the associated ecological and health risks. The microbiological responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels are primarily mediated by the C balance in agricultural activities; however, the underlying mechanisms involved in plant&ndash;soil&ndash;microbe interactions under heavy metal stress are still unclear. Thus, in this study, the challenges and perspectives with regard to controlling heavy metal pollution and optimizing crop yields while reducing greenhouse emissions in agricultural ecosystems responsive to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels are discussed. Considering the integrated benefits of intensive agriculture and food security under a future changing climate, the summarized findings provided in this study may help to develop applicable remediation approaches for sustainably managing heavy metal polluted soils.</Abstract>

    <Abstract><i>Root rot</i> caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> is a serious root disease that affects the growth and yield of peanut crops worldwide. Identifying resistance genes is of great significance for both conventional and molecular breeding. At present, there are a few identified disease resistance genes, and the defense response mechanism against this pathogen remains unclear. Using transcriptome analysis techniques, 21 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in plants treated with <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> TG5 and carbendazim. Among these DEGs, the TIFY10A protein gene, pyruvate decarboxylase, and UDP glycosyltransferase 74B1 genes play an important role in early resistance to <i>root rot</i> in peanut plants, leading to regulatory factors that trigger immunity. Our study provides important information on the response mechanism of peanut plants to <i>F. oxysporum</i>-induced <i>root rot</i> and the protective benefits of colonization by the microbial pesticide, <i>B. thuringiensis</i>.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Sorghum is uniquely adapted to dryland and used by the Indonesian government to optimize the utilization of dryland and increase farmers&rsquo; incomes. The objective of this study was to analyze the contribution of sorghum to increasing income and the level of welfare of dryland farmer households in Wonogiri, Central Java, Indonesia. The study was conducted from October to December 2022 using a survey method through direct interviews with purposively selected sorghum-growing farmers. A set of questions included household income and expenditure. The average total income and expenditure indicators, poverty line figures, RMW, and ERFHI were used to measure the welfare level of farmer households. The study found that the income derived from sorghum contributes 22.87% to total household income and tends to increase household income by 29.65%. According to the average total income earned, farming households were in a prosperous condition. This can be seen from the total income, which is higher than the total expenditure, the average per capita income higher than the poverty line, the average total income higher than RMW, and the value of ERFHI at 1.25. Income derived from sorghum has increased by 21.43&ndash;56.00% from less prosperous households to prosperous ones. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the existing literature on sorghum development and farmers&rsquo; income and to be a reference for policy makers in formulating poverty alleviation programs and improving the welfare of farmer households, as well as expanding sorghum development by optimizing the utilization of agroecological, economic and social resources.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of olive oil addition on the production, chemical composition, and fatty acid profile of sheep&rsquo;s milk. Twenty-four lactating ewes with a live weight of 34.6 &plusmn; 4.61 kg were used. The animals were randomly distributed into four treatments (<i>n</i> = 6) with dietary addition of 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% (dry matter basis) olive oil for 45 days. Milk samples were taken every 7 days for fatty acid (FA) and chemical analyses. A decrease (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in dry matter and crude protein intake was observed with 4% oil inclusion. Milk production and milk components were similar between treatments. The kilograms of meat from weaned lambs linearly increased as the oil inclusion increased. Milk C4:0 to C17:0 decreased with 2% olive oil. The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA content in the milk increased with the oil inclusion. There was an increase in the milk&rsquo;s linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid content with 2% olive oil. Overall, the addition of 2% extra virgin olive oil is recommended to improve milk&rsquo;s FA profile without negative effects on animal performance.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Agricultural soils serve as crucial storage sites for soil organic carbon (SOC). Their appropriate management is pivotal for mitigating climate change. Continuous monitoring is imperative to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in SOC within agricultural fields. In-field datasets of Vis-NIR soil spectra were collected on a long-term experimental site using an on-the-go spectrophotometer. Data processing for continuous SOC prediction involves a two-step modeling approach. In Step 1, a partial least square (PLSR) regression model is trained to establish a relationship between the SOC content and spectral information, including spectral preprocessing. In Step 2, the predicted SOC content obtained from the PLSR models is interpolated using ordinary kriging. Among the tested spectral preprocessing techniques and semivariogram models, Savitzky&ndash;Golay and the Gap-Segment derivative preprocessing along with a Gaussian semivariogram model, yielded the best performance resulting in a root mean square error of 1.24 and 1.26 g kg<sup>&minus;1</sup>. A striping effect due to the transect-based data collection was addressed by testing the effectiveness of extending the spatial separation distance, employing data aggregation, and defining the distribution based on treatment plots using block kriging. Overall, the results highlight the high potential of on-the-go spectral Vis-NIR data for field-scale spatial-temporal monitoring of SOC.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In a young super-high-density (SHD) olive orchard located in Aidone (EN), in the Sicily Region, Italy, the architectural features of five olive cultivars were studied, specifically Arbequina, Arbosana, Oliana<sup>&reg;</sup>, Giulia<sup>&reg;</sup>, and FS-17<sup>&reg;</sup>. Surveys were conducted in November 2019 considering biometric measurements for the whole tree, the canopy, and the primary and secondary branches. The &ldquo;total branching frequency&rdquo;, the &ldquo;sectorial branching frequency&rdquo;, the &ldquo;total branching efficiency&rdquo;, the &ldquo;sectorial branching efficiency&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;total relative vigour&rdquo; indexes were also calculated from the previous measurements. In addition, olive yield recorded for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (respectively, the third, fourth, and fifth years from planting) are shown in order to provide a more exhaustive description of the features of the cultivars. Giulia<sup>&reg;</sup> and Oliana<sup>&reg;</sup> resulted in being more similar to Arbequina and Arbosana, presenting a compact shape of the canopy and high and regular ramification of primary and secondary branches. FS-17<sup>&reg;</sup> showed a higher expansion in canopy volume and higher vigour than the other cultivars, features that suggest it can be more susceptible to damage during mechanical harvest. Regarding the elaborated indexes, &ldquo;total branching frequency&rdquo; resulted in being not statistically different among the cultivars. &ldquo;Sectorial branching frequency&rdquo; resulted in being higher in the middle sector of the trunk height (51&ndash;100 cm) for all the tested cultivars. This study supplies helpful information about the different canopy and branch architectural characteristics of the five studied olive cultivars with respect to their suitability to high-density plantations.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Excessive fertilizer application, majorly nitrogen- and phosphorus-based fertilizers, in farmland has intensified environmental pollution of rivers, lakes, and other surface water bodies worldwide by agricultural non-point sources, especially the highly-mobile nitrogen. To solve nitrogen pollution in sugarcane areas, exploring the nitrogen output characteristics of agricultural watersheds in crop fields becomes necessary. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of nitrogen output during typical rainfall events in different sugarcane growth stages in a southern tropical watershed in China. Dynamic monitoring of runoff and nitrogen concentration was carried out for four rainfall events and compared among four sugarcane growth stages (Establishment; Vegetative growth; Grand growth; Ripening) during the growing season of 2018 in the Nala watershed, Kelan Reservoir, Guangxi, China. The results showed that the total dissolved nitrogen flux of the 4 rainfall events ranged from 0.08 to 9.88 kg&middot;hm<sup>&minus;2</sup> for the different growth stages. Nitrate nitrogen was the main component of the total flux, accounting between 75.7 and 92.1% of the total dissolved nitrogen while ammonium nitrogen accounted between 1.80 and 5.26% of the total flux for the 4 rainfall events. Total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen were significantly and negatively correlated with runoff (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while total dissolved nitrogen concentration did not correlate with runoff. The incipient scouring effect of total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen was not noticeable. The concentration of total dissolved nitrogen in the Nala watershed was inferior to class V water quality standard, indicating water eutrophication danger. The study showed that nitrogen nutrient inflow into the river was promoted by N-fertilization time and rainfall. Therefore, reasonably reducing N-fertilization dose and post-rain fertilization could effectively reduce nitrogen inflow into rivers and avoid the intensification of eutrophication in sugarcane areas. We recommend multiple years of studies to verify the possible impacts of differences in weather conditions.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Lettuce is one of the most widely planted leafy vegetables in plant factories. The lack of trace elements in nutrient solutions has caused huge losses to the lettuce industry. Non-obvious symptoms of trace element deficiency, the inconsistent size of the characteristic areas, and the difficulty of extraction in different growth stages are three key problems affecting lettuce deficiency symptom identification. In this study, a batch of cream lettuce (lactuca sativa) was planted in the plant factory, and its nutrient elements were artificially controlled. We collected images of the lettuce at different growth stages, including all nutrient elements and three nutrient-deficient groups (potassium deficiency, calcium deficiency, and magnesium deficiency), and performed feature extraction analysis on images of different defects. We used traditional algorithms (k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest) and lightweight deep-learning models (ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, andMobileNetV2) for classification, and we compared different feature extraction methods (texture features, color features, scale-invariant feature transform features). The experiment shows that, under the optimal feature extraction method (color), the random-forest recognition results are the best, with an accuracy rate of 97.6%, a precision rate of 97.9%, a recall rate of 97.4%, and an F1 score of 97.6%. The accuracies of all three deep-learning models exceed 99.5%, among which ShuffleNet is the best, with the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score above 99.8%. It also uses fewer floating-point operations per second and less time. The proposed method can quickly identify the trace elements lacking in lettuce, and it can provide technical support for the visual recognition of the disease patrol robot in the plant factory.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>GGPPS (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase) is a crucial enzyme in the terpene biosynthesis pathway. Terpenoids play essential roles in chlorophyll biosynthesis and the development of cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> L. var. <i>capitata</i> L.), a major cruciferous vegetable worldwide. However, limited information is available regarding <i>B. oleracea</i> GGPPS genes. In this study, we examined 10 <i>BoGGPPS</i> genes from the <i>B. oleracea</i> genome. The subcellular localization prediction suggests that BoGGPPS proteins are mainly expressed in chloroplasts and plastids. Similar <i>BoGGPPS</i> genes exhibited a similar structure and motif. Distribution, collinearity, and Ka/Ks analysis revealed multiple duplication events within the <i>BoGGPPS</i> gene family. Cabbage <i>BoGGPPS</i> may participate in light and hormone responses via analysis of <i>cis</i>-acting elements. Three-dimensional structure analysis demonstrated the abundance of &alpha;-helices and random coils among <i>BoGGPPS</i> members, suggesting their important functions. Based on qRT-PCR, we observed notable differences in the transcript levels of <i>BoGGPPS</i> genes between leaves and siliques. <i>Bol028967</i> exhibited significantly higher transcript levels in WT (Wild-type) siliques compared to in <i>Boas1</i> (<i>Brassica oleracea albino silique 1</i>), and subcellular localization analysis confirmed its expression in chloroplasts, implying its essential role in chloroplast synthesis. These findings lay the groundwork for further exploration and in-depth functional analysis of <i>BoGGPPS</i> genes and their relationship with terpenoids in the context of chlorophyll synthesis in <i>B. oleracea</i>.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The degree of the effect of digital inclusive finance on the construction of China&rsquo;s digital villages and the mechanism of action is investigated in this study by matching the digital inclusive finance index in accordance with a data sample of China&rsquo;s provincial digital villages from 2013 to 2020. As indicated by the result of this study, first, the development of digital inclusive finance positively expedites the development of digital villages. Second, geographical and dimensional differences exist when digital inclusive finance boosts the construction of digital villages. Third, digital inclusive finance is capable of facilitating the construction of digital villages by deepening technological innovation and communication infrastructure construction and further enhancing the digital literacy of residents. Fourth, a positive moderating effect of internal conditions of rural residents&rsquo; consumption and external conditions of financial regulation is reported when digital inclusive finance promotes digital rural development. Based on the above-mentioned findings, the following policy recommendations are presented to advance digital countryside construction in depth. First, following the goal of building Chinese modernization, differentiated policies, with regional resource endowments, social conditions, and rural characteristics considered, should be implemented in accordance with local conditions. Second, the digitalization process in rural areas should be vigorously boosted, and it is imperative to optimize and upgrade mobile communication infrastructure, with the aim of injecting new momentum into China&rsquo;s digital countryside construction. Third, investment in scientific and technological research and development funds and high-level innovative talents should be increased to endow digital technology with better independent innovation capacity and facilitate the level of innovation. Fourth, investment in education should be increased to enhance the digital literacy of urban and rural residents.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Agricultural ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions can have serious environmental impacts, lower fertiliser nitrogen-use efficiencies, and cause economic losses. NH<sub>3</sub> losses may not only occur directly from organic fertilisers such as biogas digestates when applied to crops, the crops themselves may also be a source of ammonia emissions. Wheat yields from 14 years of an organic small plot fertiliser trial fertilised with biogas digestate were analysed to determine if there was significant lateral N transfer between plots. A simple NH<sub>3</sub> loss/gain model was developed to calculate possible N gains and losses via NH<sub>3</sub> volatilisation from the applied digestate. This model was tested using NH<sub>3</sub> volatilisation measurements. In addition, <sup>15</sup>N isotope measurements of crop biomass were used to analyse plant N uptake. While digestate fertilisation increased wheat yields, yield patterns indicated that NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from plots fertilised with biogas digestate affected yields in neighbouring unfertilised plots. Measurements of ammonia losses and gains in the field validated our modelling results, showing that 55% of digestate NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N was volatilised. <sup>15</sup>N isotope analysis indicated that crops took up as much as 30 kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> NH<sub>3</sub>-N volatilised from digestate, and that plots closer to fertilised plots took up more of this NH<sub>3</sub>-N than crops further away from fertilised plots. Our results imply that neither the results from the fertilised plots nor from the unfertilised plots are without bias. To avoid inadvertently introducing artefacts into fertiliser field trials, plot sizes need to be increased and treatments situated further apart.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Sample size fluctuation and the restriction of measurements that demonstrate kinetics (typical of physiological processes) are two of the largest inferential constraints in studies on embryonic development in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that a practical and robust way of aggregating knowledge on aspects of embryonic development in vitro is to use measurements based on the binary counting component. These are typically used to measure the germination process (intraeminal embryonal development). Our biological model was Dragon&rsquo;s blood (<i>Croton lechleri</i> M&uuml;ll Arg.), a species native to the Amazon with great socioeconomic impact. Matrices originating from two populations (one native and another cultivated) were the source of biological material. From this material, we studied five sampling densities (5, 25, 50, and 100 embryos), forming a 2 &times; 4 factorial ANOVA. Among the measurements studied, the coefficient of variation of time, uncertainty, and the synchronization index were the most sensitive to sample-size fluctuation. The synchronization index, however, also proved to be an interesting measurement to detect the parental effect related to the place of occurrence of the matrices. The embryonic development ability, mean development time, and mean development rate were not affected by fluctuations in the sample size or the origin of the material, demonstrating highly conserved traits of the species. Finally, in general, the measurements based on binary counting demonstrated robustness for modeling embryonic growth.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The construction of national parks has a profound impact on the production and life of surrounding farmers. Based on the survey data of 354 farmers around the Mount Wuyi National Park, this paper uses the method of constructing a difference-in-difference model to analyze the impact of the Mount Wuyi National Park construction on the livelihood choices of surrounding farmers and the main income of families. In addition, this article analyzes the heterogeneity of surrounding farmers based on differences in tea planting area and farmers&rsquo; income levels. The results show the following: First, compared with pre-establishment, farmers around the Mount Wuyi National Park still prefer tea-based agricultural employment or part-time employment. Second, after the establishment of the Mount Wuyi National Park, the main income of surrounding farmers&rsquo; families is still agricultural income. Therefore, the authors of this article believe that it is necessary to further strengthen the protection of the livelihoods of surrounding farmers and moderately create more livelihood choices for surrounding farmers in order to achieve both ecological and economic benefits.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Circadian rhythms affect the physiology and behavior of most organisms. The ovulation&ndash;laying cycle of poultry exhibits evident rhythmic patterns. However, the underlying biological mechanism has remained unclear. Herein, Yangzhou goose (<i>Anser cygnoides</i>) were selected at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00 (<i>n</i> = 6/timepoint) to investigate the regulation of circadian egg-laying through the light-driven melatonin secretion. Our study revealed that the laying rates displayed diurnal fluctuations, with a peak of 40% of eggs being laid between 4:00 and 7:00. The cosine analysis revealed that the expression of clock genes exhibited rhythmicities (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Relevantly, melatonin secretion also displayed circadian rhythmicity and sharply decreases with increasing amount of light (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The immunohistochemical analysis found that the melatonin receptor is highly expressed during the night period. Notably, tissue distribution analysis further revealed that the melatonin receptor genes showed a decreasing trend in the pineal gland and hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;gonad (HPG) axis throughout the day. Concomitantly, the expression of reproduction-related genes at 12:00 was significantly higher than that at 24:00 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Taken together, these data suggested cyclical secretion of melatonin in response to photoperiod, which acts as a neuroendocrine transducer of circadian rhythm and the time preference of reproduction in domestic geese.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Rapid estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) with high accuracy is essential for monitoring crop growth status and predicting crop yield. Recently, remote sensing techniques using unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have exhibited great potential in obtaining structural information about crops and identifying spatial heterogeneity. However, methods of data fusion of different factors still need to be explored in order to enhance the accuracy of their estimates. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the combined metrics of different variables (spectral, structural and meteorological factors) for AGB estimation of wheat using UAS multispectral data. UAS images were captured on two selected growing dates at a typical reclaimed cropland in the North China Plain. The spectral response was determined using the highly correlated vegetation index (VI). A structural metric, the canopy height model (CHM), was produced using UAS-based multispectral images. The measure of growing degree days (GDD) was selected as a meteorological proxy. Subsequently, a structurally&ndash;meteorologically weighted canopy spectral response metric (SM-CSRM) was derived by the pixel-level fusion of CHM, GDD and VI. Both correlation coefficient analysis and simple function fitting were implemented to explore the highest correlation between the measured AGB and each proposed metric. The optimal regression model was built for AGB prediction using leave-one-out cross-validation. The results showed that the proposed SM-CSRM generally improved the correlation between wheat AGB and various VIs and can be used for estimating the wheat AGB. Specifically, the combination of MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), vegetation-masked CHM (mCHM) and normalized GDD (nGDD) achieved an optimal accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8069, RMSE = 0.1667 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, nRMSE = 19.62%) through the polynomial regression method. This improved the nRMSE by 3.44% compared to the predictor using MTCI &times; mCHM. Moreover, the pixel-level fusion method slightly enhanced the nRMSE by ~0.3% for predicted accuracy compared to the feature-level fusion method. In conclusion, this paper demonstrated that an SM-CSRM using pixel-level fusion with canopy spectral, structural and meteorological factors can obtain a good level of accuracy for wheat biomass prediction. This finding could benefit the assessment of reclaimed cropland or the monitoring of crop growth and field management in precision agriculture.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Drought conditions pose significant challenges to sustainable agriculture and food security. Identifying microbial strains that can mitigate drought effects is crucial to enhance crop resilience and productivity. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict optimal microbial strains for this purpose. Models were assessed on multiple metrics, such as accuracy, standard deviation of results, gains, total computation time, and training time per 1000 rows of data. Notably, the Gradient Boosted Trees model outperformed others in accuracy but required extensive computational resources. This underscores the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency in machine learning applications. Leveraging machine learning for selecting microbial strains signifies a leap beyond traditional methods, offering improved efficiency and efficacy. These insights hold profound implications for agriculture, especially concerning drought mitigation, thus furthering the cause of sustainable agriculture and ensuring food security.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Panicle length (PL) is an important trait closely related to rice yield. More than 200 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PL have been identified, but only a few can be used for breeding. Dongxiang wild rice contains many excellent genes, and mining favorable PL-related QTL from DXWR is helpful for rice variety improvement. Here, we report a QTL analysis for PL using a recombinant inbred line population consisting of 143 individuals derived from a cross between Dongxiang wild rice and indica cultivar Guangluai 4. A total of four QTL (<i>qPL1-37</i>, <i>qPL4-26</i>, <i>qPL7-25</i>, and <i>qPL8-4</i>) for PL were identified and located on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, and 8. Among them, <i>qPL7-25</i> showed the largest F-value of 32.32 and 16.80, and the QTL explained 18.66% and 13.06% of the phenotypic variation of Dongxiang wild rice in Hangzhou and Hainan, respectively. QTL mapping was performed using a population of 1800 individuals derived from the crossing of NIL-<i>qPL7-25</i> and GLA4. <i>qPL7-25</i> was located between two InDel markers, InDel-24591 and InDel-24710, in a 119 kb region containing 14 predicted genes. Using Sanger sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis, we propose that <i>LOC_Os07g41200</i> is probably a new allele of the well-known <i>GL7</i> gene, which affects grain length and appearance quality in rice. These results provide new insights into the use of molecular marker-assisted selection for breeding high-yielding and high-quality rice varieties.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Transitioning from fossil to renewable energy is a global challenge, especially for countries with large fossil-fuel reserves and exports, such as Iran. This study analyses agricultural students&rsquo; knowledge of, attitudes toward, and perceptions of renewable energies in the agriculture sector in Guilan Province in Iran. The research was based on a structured questionnaire comprising three sections: (i) respondents&rsquo; socio-demographics; (ii) practicality and relevance of academic material and curriculum; and (iii) respondents&rsquo; knowledge of and attitudes and perceptions toward renewable energies in agriculture. The results showed that students&rsquo; attitudes regarding renewable energies ranked highest, and their perception was lowest. The results also showed a positive and significant relationship between the respondents&rsquo; knowledge, marital status, age, and level of education. Moreover, respondents&rsquo; age and educational level significantly impacted their attitudes. Cluster analysis divided students&rsquo; behavior into three different clusters. These clusters were most affected by attitude. In clustering students&rsquo; behavior towards using renewable energies, 38.5%, 33.5%, and 28% of respondents were positioned in the first, third, and second clusters, respectively. This is a pioneering study analyzing agricultural students&rsquo; behavior regarding renewable energies in agriculture in Guilan Province, Iran. The results of this study can assist agricultural organizations, politicians in the field of energy, and local authorities in promoting sustainable energy in Guilan Province.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The agricultural sector receives substantial support from livestock, which greatly contributes to the well-being of rural communities. Livestock offers animal-derived products, such as meat and milk, which serve as abundant protein sources for human consumption. While the majority of South Africa&rsquo;s agricultural land is suitable for livestock farming within the smallholder sector, these farmers often face a variety of challenges. Among these challenges, there is insufficient access to superior forage resources, resulting in the limited availability of high-quality feed. Traditional nutrient sources for ruminants, such as soybean meal, grain, sunflower meal, and fish meal, are employed as supplementary feeds to provide exceptional nutrition and improve animal performance. Nonetheless, they present logistical, economic, and environmental challenges. To circumvent these challenges, smallholder producers have turned to leguminous trees, including <i>Vachellia</i> species and other locally available feed resources. They are utilized as feasible and cost-effective alternatives to supplement livestock, especially during periods of extended drought. However, these locally available feed resources exhibit inherent limitations, including thorn presence, high fiber content, low digestibility, and the presence of anti-nutritional and toxic factors. Cool season forage crops such as fodder radish present promising alternatives as autumn and winter forages for these farmers. Despite being widely used globally as a supplement for livestock during winter, fodder radish remains relatively underutilized, particularly among smallholder farmers. There is a scarcity of comprehensive information regarding its chemical composition, nutrient utilization, and remarkable potential to revolutionize livestock production, especially within the smallholder sector. Most of the available literature demonstrates the positive effects of fodder radish on soil structure, soil carbon and nitrogen levels, weed suppression, and other benefits. This paper systematically reviews the current state of knowledge on the nutritive value, opportunities, and challenges associated with the utilization of this crop in the cooler eastern regions.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study examined the potential of using the endophytic bacteria <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (10-4 and 26D) to enrich hydroponically grown potato seed minitubers (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L. cv. Bashkirsky) to improve plant growth, photosynthetic pigments, yield, and quality parameters, including nutritional value (i.e., macro-/microelements, vitamin C, anthocyanins). Potato seed minitubers, obtained from in-vitro-grown microplants in a hydroponic system, were inoculated with endophytic <i>B. subtilis</i> and subsequently grown in pots under controlled conditions. The results demonstrated the successful colonization of seed minitubers by <i>B. subtilis</i>, with subsequent distribution into growing plants (roots, shoots). The endophytes accelerated the plant&rsquo;s phenological shifts, resulting in earlier emergence of sprouts, budding, and flowering compared with control plants. They also had increased leaf photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll (Chl) a, Chl b, and carotenoids), total leaf area, and positively influenced leaf proline contents. The height of plants and number of stems per plant did not change significantly upon endophyte treatment, but improved root growth was observed throughout the experiment. As a result of endophyte application, there was an increase in stolon weight, number and size of tubers, and overall tuber yield. There were no significant differences in terms of total dry matter and starch content of the tubers compared to the control group, but the sugar levels decreased and the size of the starch grains was larger in endophyte-treated tubers. Furthermore, endophyte treatment resulted in an increased accumulation of nutrients including N, P, K, Cu, and Fe, as well as vitamin C and anthocyanins in harvested tubers. These findings indicate that colonization of hydroponically grown potato seed minitubers with endophytic <i>B. subtilis</i> (10-4 and 26D) before planting has great potential as an eco-friendly approach to obtain higher-quality seeds and to increase tuber yield and nutritional value in field conditions.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The accurate evaluation of crop damage by wild animals is crucial for farmers when seeking compensation from insurance companies or other institutions. One of the game species that frequently cause crop damage in Europe is the wild boar, which often feeds on maize. Other game species, such as roe deer and red deer, can also cause significant crop damage. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of crop damage evaluation based on remote sensing data derived from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially a digital surface model (DSM) based on RGB imagery and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) derived from multispectral imagery, at two growth stages of maize. During the first growth stage, when plants are in the intensive growth phase and green, crop damage evaluation was conducted using both DSM and NDVI. Each variable was separately utilized, and both variables were included in the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, wherein crop damage was categorized as a binomial variable (with or without crop damage). In the second growth stage, which was before harvest when the plants had dried, only DSM was employed for crop damage evaluation. The results for both growth stages demonstrated high accuracy in detecting areas with crop damage, but this was primarily observed for areas larger than several square meters. The accuracy of crop damage evaluation was significantly lower for smaller or very narrow areas, such as the width of a single maize row. DSM proved to be more useful than NDVI in detecting crop damage as it can be applied at any stage of maize growth.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study aimed to design a counter-rotating dual-axis spiral ditcher to address the problems of the lack of ditching models, low ditching quality, and high power consumption in ditching operations in hilly and mountainous orchards. By establishing a discrete element simulation model of the interaction between the dual-spiral cutter and the soil, we analyzed the effects of different operating parameters on the ditching performance and power consumption to explore the mechanism of the interaction between the soil-engaging components and the soil; meanwhile, according to the simulation data, we took the forward speed, cutter speed, and ditching depth as the experimental influencing factors, and we took the ditching qualification rate and power consumption as the experimental indicators. Then, through a three-factor and three-level orthogonal experimental analysis, we obtained the optimal parameter combination. Based on the optimized simulation results, a prototype ditcher was fabricated, and the results of a soil trough test showed that the ditcher had a stable ditching performance, an average ditching qualification rate of 91.4%, an average soil crushing rate of 72%, and a ditching adjustment structure that could adjust the ditching depth and width within the ranges of 15&ndash;25 cm and 10&ndash;20 cm, respectively. The optimized ditcher had high efficiency, stability, and energy savings during its operation, and it was able to meet the agronomic requirements for ditching operations. This study provides a design basis and technical support for dual-spiral trial ditching operations.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Chestnuts are multipurpose trees that grow mainly in the Northern Hemisphere due to their aptitude for fruit and wood production. These trees are vastly significant for the economy and wildlife. The widespread distribution of these trees demonstrates their genetic adaptability to many environmental conditions. The main varieties of European chestnut (<i>Castanea sativa</i> Miller) cultivated in Portugal, their productive challenges and breeding and biotechnological efforts developed over the last decades are described. This paper highlights the efforts focused on the improvement of varieties and rootstocks through selection and hybridization of European chestnut with the Asian species <i>Castanea crenata</i> Siebold and Zuccarini and <i>Castanea mollissima</i> Blume, which are resistant to ink disease, which have been the foundation of the Portuguese chestnut breeding programs. Breeding and biotechnological efforts developed over the last decades, focused on ink disease and chestnut blight resistance, are described. The potentialities of this research to stimulate the competitiveness of bioeconomy-based knowledge and innovation in the productive chestnut sector is also discussed.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This paper aims to find a fertilization method that better matches the growth characteristics of vegetables and reduces the soil and environmental problems caused by unreasonable fertilization methods, in view of the strong buffering of the clayey black soil in the north and the mismatch between the amount of chemical fertilizer applied and the growth characteristics of vegetables during cultivation. In this experiment, <i>Lactuca sativa</i> L. (<i>Lactuca sativa</i>) was studied in a randomized complete block design in greenhouse and five different fertilizer application methods were arranged: exponential fertilization (EF), linear fertilization (LF), average fertilization (AF), one-time fertilization (OF), and no fertilization as a control group (CG). The effects of different fertilization methods on soil nutrients, agronomic traits of <i>Lactuca sativa</i> growth, and related quality were investigated, and the pattern of effects of different fertilization methods on growth and soil nutrients was obtained. The results of the experiment showed that the exponential fertilization method gradually took advantage as the growth time extended. The plant height (PLH), leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), yield, soluble protein (SP), soluble sugar (SS), vitamin C (VC), and elemental nitrogen (EN) and potassium (EK) of <i>Lactuca sativa</i> were significantly improved under the exponential fertilization method compared with other fertilization methods, by 29.9 cm, 51.5 cm, 5.96 cm, 22, 2.32 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 0.23%, 0.44%, 3.93%, 94.66 mg/kg, 1.58 g/kg, and 1.94 g/kg, respectively. The alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen (SAN), available phosphorus (SAP), and available potassium (SAK) in the soil after fertilization were 139.69 mg/kg, 50.23 mg/kg, and 180.30 mg/kg, respectively. The above results showed that the exponential fertilization method not only improved the quality of <i>Lactuca sativa</i> and thus the quality of the crop growth traits, but also changed the soil nutrients favorably after fertilization, which is of some importance for the protection of black soils.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The present work aimed to assess the nutrient digestibility of soybean meal (SBM) products based on in vitro procedures. Two-step and three-step in vitro assays were performed to mimic the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the digestive tracts of growing swine. The two-step in vitro method was modified to reflect the digesta retention time and digestive enzymes of nursery piglets by decreasing incubation periods and digestive enzymes to half of those in the procedure for growing pigs and was used to determine the crude protein (CP) digestibility of nursery piglets. The seven ingredients included conventional SBM, thermo-mechanically processed SBM (TSBM), and five sources of fermented SBM (FSBM). The five sources of FSBM were produced using different microorganisms for fermentation, namely: (1) <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, (2) <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (FSBM-EF), (3) <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, (4) <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, and (5) <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>. Based on the conventional procedure, the in vitro ileal disappearance of CP in TSBM was greater (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in FSBM sources. Based on the in vitro assays for total tract digestibility, organic matter in TSBM was better digested (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in FSBM except for FSBM-EF. Based on the in vitro procedure for nursery piglets, the ileal disappearance of CP in TSBM was greater (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than that in the other SBM products. Taken together, thermo-mechanical processing rather than microbial fermentation of SBM improves the nutrient digestibility of SBM, particularly in nursery pigs.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Selenium (Se) deficiency in human and animal nutrition is primarily due to low levels of Se in soils. It can be prevented by enriching crops, such as wheat, with Se through agronomic biofortification. Although Se is not essential for plants, it shows a dual effect on their metabolism depending on its concentration. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of five different concentrations (0.4, 4, 20, 40, and 400 mg/kg) of selenate and selenite on the oxidative status and antioxidative response of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L., cv. Kraljica) shoots and roots. According to morpho-physiological analyses, selenite was found to have a lower toxicity threshold than selenate. The measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers showed that Se did not cause oxidative damage to wheat seedlings due to the activation of detoxification mechanisms at the biochemical level, which depended on the type of tissue, concentration, and form of applied Se. Treatment with 20 mg/kg of selenate can be recommended for wheat seedling biofortification due to a sufficient increase in Se accumulation in shoots without signs of toxicity. These results contribute to a better understanding of wheat seedlings&rsquo; physiological and biochemical responses to Se and the development of more effective biofortification strategies.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study developed a multi-year classification model for winter cereal in a semi-arid region, the Kairouan area (Tunisia). A random forest classification model was constructed using Sentinel 2 (S2) vegetation indices for a reference agricultural season, 2020/2021. This model was then applied using S2 and Landsat (7 and 8) data for previous seasons from 2011 to 2022 and validated using field observation data. The reference classification model achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.3%. Using S2 data resulted in higher overall classification accuracy. Cereal classification exhibited excellent precision ranging from 85.8% to 95.1% when utilizing S2 data, while lower accuracy (41% to 91.8%) was obtained when using only Landsat data. A slight confusion between cereals and cereals growing with olive trees was observed. A second objective was to map cereals as early as possible in the agricultural season. An early cereal classification model demonstrated accurate results in February (four months before harvest), with a precision of 95.2% and an OA of 87.7%. When applied to the entire period, February cereal classification exhibited a precision ranging from 85.1% to 94.2% when utilizing S2 data, while lower accuracy (42.6% to 95.4%) was observed in general with Landsat data. This methodology could be adopted in other cereal regions with similar climates to produce very useful information for the planner, leading to a reduction in fieldwork.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Dual use of water for fish and crop production could be a promising approach to improve irrigation under arid conditions. A watercress pot study was carried out to assess the effects of irrigation by catfish and tilapia aquaculture water on the sandy soil properties as well as the growth parameters of watercress with various combinations of artificial NPK fertilizers at El-Minia Governorate of Egypt (28&deg;18&prime;16&Prime; N latitude and 30&deg;34&prime;38&Prime; E longitude). Catfish aquaculture water had the greatest phytoplankton abundance at 83,762 units (&times;10<sup>4</sup>/L), while the minimum number of phytoplankton existed in tilapia aquaculture water, recorded at 14,873 units (&times;10<sup>4</sup>/L). There were significant average changes that varied from 120 to 237 (&times;10<sup>4</sup> cfu/mL<sup>&minus;1</sup>) in total bacterial counts in tilapia and catfish waters. Watercress growth quality parameters closely paralleled at all NPK application rates, indicating that the highest quality plants were produced in pots receiving 25% of the recommended levels and irrigated with catfish aquaculture water. Nitrate concentrations of watercress plants were determined under pollution levels established by the European Commission for leafy and tuber vegetables. In conclusion, the use of microbial and phytoplankton-rich aquaculture water to irrigate vegetables and as fertilizer can maintain a balanced soil ecosystem.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To solve the problem of low straw-cutting efficiency of single-disc openers of no-till planters under conditions of high soil moisture content, a single-disc furrowing and straw-cutting device was designed based on the support-cutting principle. To improve the straw-cutting ability of the disc opener when it operates under high-moisture-content soil conditions and to make sure that the straw that is not cut by the disc coulter can be cut smoothly by the disc opener, the support shovel was designed, and the operation mechanism of the support shovel device was analyzed. The soil moisture content, the support shovel&rsquo;s entry angle, the support shovel&rsquo;s entry gap angle, and the support shovel&rsquo;s tip margin were identified as the factors influencing the device design through the theoretical analysis of the furrowing and straw-cutting device. Through the discrete element method (DEM), a single-factor simulation test was first conducted to analyze how different soil moisture contents affected the device&rsquo;s ability to cut straw, and the results showed that the number of broken bonds was lowest when the soil moisture content was 20 &plusmn; 1%, and the time taken for the straw to be wholly cut off was also the longest. Then, a quadratic orthogonal simulation test was conducted to construct a regression model and optimize the parameters at the soil moisture content of 20 &plusmn; 1%, and the results revealed that the significant order of each factor&rsquo;s influence on the number of broken bonds is as follows: entry gap angle, entry angle, and shovel tip margin. In addition, the device&rsquo;s overall operation quality was better when the entry angle was 49&deg;, the entry gap angle was 0&deg;, and the shovel tip margin was 10 mm. At this time, the number of broken bonds was predicted to be 506. Finally, the simulation validation test was run, and the number of broken bonds was obtained to be 478, with a relative error of 5.6% from the predicted value. According to the optimal parameters to complete the device trial production and field test, the results show that the average cut-off rate of the device is 71.7%, the stability coefficient of the furrowing depth is 90.87%, and the performance of the furrow opening is excellent, which meets the requirements of a no-tillage seeding operation. This study can provide a reference for the design and improvement of no-tillage seeding machines under conditions of high soil moisture content.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Adjuvants are supplemental substances added to pesticide tank mixtures to enhance their efficacy by altering the dispersing, emulsifying, spreading, sticking, and wetting properties of the spray mixture. The goals of this study were an assessment of the effectiveness of pyraclostrobin and boscalid against garlic rust; the fungicide&rsquo;s dissipation and translocation within plant tissue in the presence of commercial adjuvants Dash<sup>&reg;</sup> HC EC; and the validation of an analytical method for concurrently determining boscalid and pyraclostrobin in green garlic and garlic bulbs. Pyraclostrobin and boscalid retention in green garlic and the dietary exposure risks were also evaluated. The adjuvant Dash<sup>&reg;</sup> HC EC is an emulsifiable concentrate containing fatty acids, methyl esters, and alkoxylated alcohol&ndash;phosphate esters. The test plots were sprayed with the maximum recommended dosage of 400.5&thinsp;g a.i. ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> boscalid and 100.5&thinsp;g a.i. ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> pyraclostrobin. The residues of pyraclostrobin and boscalid in garlic bulb and green garlic samples were determined using a mini-Luke multi-residue solvent extraction method paired with a high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detector (HPLC&ndash;DAD). This method is based on the extraction of a homogeneous sample with acetone, petroleum ether, and dichloromethane. Boscalid and pyraclostrobin recoveries in green garlic and garlic bulbs ranged from 71% to 107% on average, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 6.8% to 18.1%, and limits of quantification were 0.02 mg/kg. In green garlic and garlic bulbs, boscalid residues ranged from 0.14 to 3.51 mg/kg and pyraclostrobin from lower than LOQ to 1.43 mg/kg, during the experiment. The adjuvant increased the fungicidal efficacy of the fungicides and their retention on green garlic. Although boscalid is considered a nonsystemic fungicide, it showed higher translocation from garlic leaves to garlic bulbs than pyraclostrobin. Regarding the dietary risk assessment, the use of the adjuvant in a tank mixture with boscalid and pyraclostrobin is considered safe 14 days after application, which agrees with the recommended PHI.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Rust is one of the main diseases affecting wheat crops in Spain, causing significant yield and quality losses. Research on its identification and quantification in the air is a worldwide priority due to the importance of this crop as a source of food and feed. The objective of this study is to determine the temporal variation of airborne spores of <i>Puccinia</i> and their relationship with meteorological variables and the phenological development of a wheat crop in Northwestern Spain during two growing seasons. The study was conducted in A Limia, Ourense, located in Northwestern Spain, during the wheat growing seasons of 2021 and 2022. The Lanzoni VPPS 2010 spore trap was used to collect airborne spores, which were identified using optical microscopy. The wheat growing season was less than 95 days during both years, and wheat rust spores were detected during all phenological stages of the crop. Concentrations were higher than 100 spores/m<sup>3</sup> from the booting stage to senescence, mainly in 2021. Statistical analyses showed that temperature was the meteorological variable that most influenced <i>Puccinia</i> concentrations in the air in both years. The modification of a prediction model proposed by other authors for wheat rust, which takes into account mean temperature (10&ndash;25 &deg;C), dew point temperature (&lt;5 &deg;C), and nighttime temperature (10&ndash;20 &deg;C), allowed us to tentatively predict the increase in <i>Puccinia</i> concentrations in the year 2022 when these conditions occurred for four or five consecutive days. This research is the first in Spain to report the presence of rust-causing <i>Puccinia</i> spores in the air during all phenological stages of the wheat crop and provides useful information for designing management strategies, considering temperature values.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Sugarcane is one of the essential raw materials for sugar production worldwide. From a present perspective, extending the storage time of sugarcane after harvest is a crucial step toward increasing sugar production. Particularly, sugarcane harvested by sugarcane harvesters is more susceptible to biological damage due to the increased number of wounds created during harvesting. Once harvested, the most effective way to reduce bio-injury is to deliver sugarcane to the factory as soon as possible. In recent years, microwave radiation has been increasingly used in food products to reduce biological contamination. The present study examines the effect of microwave irradiation on the sucrose loss that occurs in post-harvest sugarcane. A microwave was employed for different time intervals, particularly from 5 to 9 s at a 2450 MHz frequency and 5100 W power. The results reveal that microwave radiation can effectively kill microorganisms in sugarcane wounds in a very short time. With a microwave irradiation time of 6 s, a microbial disinfection efficiency of 91.2% was achieved. The maximum temperature in the billets at that time was only 35.1 &deg;C. Microwave radiation reduced the sucrose loss rate due to a significant decrease in the number of microflora during the 48 h period. As a result, the storage time of harvested sugarcane was prolonged, leading to improved economic benefits in sugar extraction.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>This study aimed to demonstrate the application of process mining on video data of pigs, facilitating the analysis of behavioral patterns. Video data were collected over a period of 5 days from a pig pen in a mechanically ventilated barn and used for analysis. The approach in this study relies on a series of individual steps to allow process mining on this data set. These steps include object detection and tracking, spatiotemporal activity recognition in video data, and process model analysis. Each step gives insights into pig behavior at different time points and locations within the pen, offering increasing levels of detail to describe typical pig behavior up to process models reflecting different behavior sequences for clustered datasets. Our data-driven approach proves suitable for the comprehensive analysis of behavioral sequences in conventional pig farming.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The phytoremediation of soil contaminated with petroleum depends on the association of plants with rhizosphere bacteria capable of promoting plant growth and destroying petroleum hydrocarbonates. In the present work, we studied the effects of &ldquo;Lenoil&rdquo; biological product containing bacteria <i>Pseudomonas turukhanskensis</i> IB 1.1, capable of destroying petroleum hydrocarbons on <i>Secale cereale</i> L plants, which previously proved to be resistant to the weak oil pollution of gray forest soil and to the composition of microorganisms in their rhizosphere. The composition of microorganisms in the rhizosphere of rye roots was studied, morphometric parameters of shoots and roots of rye plants were estimated, and hormone concentration was immunoassayed under conditions of 4% petroleum pollution of the soil. Addition of petroleum to the soil increased the content of oligonitrophilic (by 24%) and hydrocarbon-oxidizing (by 33%) microorganisms; however, the content of cellulolytic (by 12.5 times) microorganisms in the rhizosphere decreased. The use of Lenoil led to a further increase in the number of cellulolytic (by 5.6 times) and hydrocarbon-oxidizing (by 3.8 times) microorganisms and a decrease in the number of oligonitrophilic (by 22.7%) microorganisms in the rhizosphere. Under petroleum pollution, the content of auxins (IAA), zeatin riboside, zeatin nucleotide, and zeatin decreased, while the content of abscisic acid (ABA) increased in the shoots of rye plants. Lenoil treatment led to an eight-fold increase in the IAA content in the roots and a decrease in the ABA content in the aerial part and in the roots. It was shown for the first time that the treatment of petroleum-contaminated soil with &ldquo;Lenoil&rdquo; increased root mass due to the development of lateral roots, concurrent with high root IAA content. Petroleum pollution increased the deposition of lignin and suberin in the roots, which strengthened the apoplastic barrier and, thus, reduced the infiltration of toxic components. The deposition of suberin and lignin decreased under &rdquo;Lenoil&rdquo; treatment, indicating a decrease in the concentration of toxic petroleum components in the soil degraded by the bacteria. Thus, the biological preparation reduced the growth-inhibiting effect of petroleum on rye plants by increasing the content of growth-stimulating phytohormones (IAA and cytokinins) and reducing the content of ABA, justifying the importance of further study of relevant hormones for the improvement of phytoremediation.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>To address the problem of poor ridging effect, a sweet potato ridging and shaping machine was designed and its overall structure and working principles were described. The design parameters of rotary tillage device, furrowing and shaping device and pressing and shaping device were determined. The motion model of soil particles on the furrowing and shaping device was analyzed, the force model of the furrowing and shaping device was established. A response surface Box&ndash;Behnken Design test was carried out to obtain the better working parameters of the sweet potato ridging and shaping machine as follows: the embedded depth is 196 mm, the forward speed is 0.82 m/s, and the soil moisture is 18%. At this time the stability coefficient of the ridge height was 99.84%. The comparative test showed that the operation performance and fuel consumption of the ridge shaping machine were better than 1GQL-2 sweet potato two rows rotary plowing and ridging machine, which met the agronomic requirements and created a good soil environment for sweet potato. The research can provide a design reference for the development and application of sweet potato transplanting machinery and ridging machinery in hilly areas.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In this study, a multi-path Vis/NIR spectroscopy system was developed to detect the presence of <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i> (Hendel) infestations of citrus fruit. Spectra were acquired for 252 citrus fruit, 126 of which were infested. Two hundred and fifty-two spectra were acquired for modeling in their un-infested stage, slightly infested stage, and seriously infested stage. The location of the infestation is unclear, and considering the impact of the light path on the location of the infestation, each citrus fruit was tested in three orientations (i.e., fruit stalks facing upward (A), fruit stalks facing horizontally (B), and fruit stalks facing downward (C)). Classification models based on joint X-Y distance, multiple transmittance calibration, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, and partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPXY-MSC-CARS-PLS-DA) were developed on the spectra of each light path, and the average spectra of the four light paths was calculated, to compare their performance in infestation classification. The results show the classification result changed with the light path and fruit orientation. The average spectra for each fruit orientation consistently gave better classification results, with overall accuracies of 92.9%, 89.3%, and 90.5% for orientations A, B, and C, respectively. Moreover, the best model had a Kappa value of 0.89, and gave 95.2%, 80.1%, and 100.0% accuracy for un-infested, slightly infested, and seriously infested citrus fruit. Furthermore, the classification results for infested citrus fruits were better when using the average spectra than using the spectrum of each single light path. Therefore, the multi-path Vis/NIR spectroscopy system is conducive to the detection of <i>B. dorsalis</i> infestation in citrus fruits.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The spread of infections and rot are crucial factors in the decrease in tomato production. Accurately segmenting the affected tomatoes in real-time can prevent the spread of illnesses. However, environmental factors and surface features can affect tomato segmentation accuracy. This study suggests an improved YOLOv8s-Seg network to perform real-time and effective segmentation of tomato fruit, surface color, and surface features. The feature fusion capability of the algorithm was improved by replacing the C2f module with the RepBlock module (stacked by RepConv), adding SimConv convolution (using the ReLU function instead of the SiLU function as the activation function) before two upsampling in the feature fusion network, and replacing the remaining conventional convolution with SimConv. The F1 score was 88.7%, which was 1.0%, 2.8%, 0.8%, and 1.1% higher than that of the YOLOv8s-Seg algorithm, YOLOv5s-Seg algorithm, YOLOv7-Seg algorithm, and Mask RCNN algorithm, respectively. Meanwhile, the segment mean average precision (segment mAP<sub>@0.5</sub>) was 92.2%, which was 2.4%, 3.2%, 1.8%, and 0.7% higher than that of the YOLOv8s-Seg algorithm, YOLOv5s-Seg algorithm, YOLOv7-Seg algorithm, and Mask RCNN algorithm. The algorithm can perform real-time instance segmentation of tomatoes with an inference time of 3.5 ms. This approach provides technical support for tomato health monitoring and intelligent harvesting.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Soil degradation and declining soil fertility are prominent issues for sustainable agricultural development in China. Therefore, it is of great significance to promote the adoption rate of conservation agriculture technology. Risk cognition and technology adoption are closely related, but this perspective is rarely focused on, and it is essential to discuss the influence of social learning on the impact. The Loess Plateau is a representative area for promoting and implementing conservation agriculture techniques. By collecting face-to-face survey data from 1268 farmers in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Ningxia provinces in China, this study used the binary probit model to examine the impact of risk cognition on the adoption of conservation agriculture technology and the influence of social learning on the impact. The results showed that risk cognition has a significant positive impact on the adoption of conservation agriculture technology; social learning significantly enhances the effect of risk cognition on farmers&rsquo; adoption of conservation agriculture technology. Both offline practical learning through &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; and online learning with ICT play an important moderating role in the impact; a high level of social learning enhances risk cognition to a greater extent and promotes enthusiasm for adopting conservation agriculture technology. Therefore, the value of farmers&rsquo; risk cognition should be considered in promoting and implementing conservation agriculture technology. Moreover, expanding offline and online social learning channels is crucial to improve farmers&rsquo; risk cognition and promote the adoption of conservation agriculture technology.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>High ammonium release from chicken manure poses a significant limitation to aerobic digestion, impeding microbial processes and inhibiting biogas production. In this study, we conducted anaerobic digestion of a mixture consisting of chicken manure and corn straw as the fermented raw material. The inoculum used was obtained from the residue of previously fermented chicken manure. To assess the inhibitory effect, we varied the ammonia levels within the range of 750&ndash;4250 mg/L by introducing ammonium chloride. The efficiency of aerobic digestion was monitored through the measurement of volatile fatty acids (VFA), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total inorganic carbon (TOC), and methane yield. Our results indicated that elevated levels of ammonia nitrogen had a suppressive impact on methane release, and this decrease followed a linear relationship with the increasing ammonia nitrogen load. Moreover, the addition of ammonia led to a slower release, with the maximum daily ammonia concentration observed at 15 days compared to the 6th day at lower ammonia levels. Furthermore, on the 40th day of aerobic digestion, the cumulative methane production at 4250 mg/L was inhibited by 41% compared to the 750 mg/L condition. The patterns of VFA, inorganic carbon, and COD reduction were consistent across all ammonia levels, with VFA and TOC levels being highest at the highest ammonia concentration and lowest at the lowest ammonia concentration. The accumulation of VFA resulted in a decrease in pH and a decline in methanogenic activity. Additionally, high ammonia levels altered the relative abundance of methanogens. Acetoclastic methanogens (<i>Methanosaeta</i>) exhibited a decrease in abundance, while hydrogenotrophic methanogens (<i>Methanosaeta</i>, <i>Methanoculleus</i>) and methylotrophic methanogens (<i>Candidatus Methanoplasma</i>) demonstrated an increase in abundance. Overall, our findings highlight the inhibitory effects of high ammonia concentrations on biogas production, providing insights into the changes in microbial composition and activity during anaerobic fermentation.</Abstract>
