It achieved that goal commendably and has proven to be durable and versatile as it is also suitable for trapping other medium-sized mammals. Major improvements have been incorporated without altering the basic design thus enabling existing traps to be readily upgraded.\nThe traps are now 15% lighter, and easier to set with a new more reliable trigger. The shroud has been discarded, and it now folds more compactly for transport and storage. The capture chamber is constructed of new materials designed to enable an animal to be extracted more readily.\nThese modifications are described in detail along with illustrations. For anyone intending on building a new trap, free professional-grade architectural drawings of the framework and components are available via the web (see text).", "keywords": "improved humane live trap, medium-sized mammals."}}
