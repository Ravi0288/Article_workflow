Understanding variation in the seasonality of breeding has relevance to the management of possum populations for both management as a pest and their conservation. The success of possums as a colonising species in New Zealand has been attributed in part to their flexible breeding behaviour. Review of available evidence suggests that photoperiod and food quantity/quality influence the variation in seasonality of breeding and their effects are modulated by interactions with factors such as density, body weight and, possibly, genetics and plant secondary compounds. Future research is suggested to tease apart the relative contributions of these various factors to the observed variation.", "keywords": null}}
